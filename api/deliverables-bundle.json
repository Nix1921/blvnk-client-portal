Each section links to the full deliverable for depth. If you're a founder, developer, content creator, or studio partner — this is the only document you need to read first.\n\n---\n\n# TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n1. [Executive Brief](#1-executive-brief)\n2.

EXECUTIVE BRIEF\n\n## The Situation\nIntus is an early-stage DTC activewear brand in Melbourne, competing in an $8.7B Australian market dominated by entrenched players (LSKD, Echt, STAX, Lorna Jane, Gymshark). The brand has no proprietary fabric, no physical retail, and no category ownership. Its current marketing uses generic activewear language (\"buttery soft\", bundle discounts) that places it directly into a Red Ocean of indistinguishable competitors.\n\n## The Opportunity\nThe brand name (\"Intus\" = Latin for \"within\") contains a powerful, untapped asset: a philosophy of inner transformation. No competitor in the Australian activewear market occupies this space. By designing a new category — **Intentional Movement** — Intus can escape the feature-comparison game entirely and own the conversation about what movement means beyond the gym.\n\n## The Strategic Position\n\n| Element | Decision |\n|---------|----------|\n| **Category** | Intentional Movement (new — Intus creates and leads this) |\n| **Positioning** | The brand for people who move with purpose through their full day |\n| **Archetype** | Magician (70%) + Sage (30%) — transformation with wisdom |\n| **Word Owned** | \"Intentional\" |\n| **POV** | \"What do you do between workouts?\" |\n| **Anchor Product** | The Kit — curated top + bottom, $100 AUD, always capitalized |\n| **Pricing Rule** | No discounts, ever. You don't discount transformation. |\n| **Channel** | TikTok + Instagram (primary), YouTube + Email (secondary) |\n| **Launch** | Lightning Strike — 2-week concentrated push (Air Wars + Ground Wars) |\n| **90-Day Revenue Target** | $50K–$80K AUD |\n\n## The Three Rules\n1. **The customer is always the Hero.** Intus is the Guide.\n2. **Never discount The Kit.** Price integrity is a Magician signal.\n3. **Never show gym interiors.** Intus lives in \"the other 23 hours.\"\n\n---\n\n# 2. MARKET INTELLIGENCE\n\n> *Full report: Deliverable 01 — Market Intelligence Report*\n\n## Market Landscape\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Australian activewear market (2025) | $8.7B USD |\n| Projected (2034) | $13.2B USD (CAGR 4.63%) |\n| Mid-range DTC segment | ~$575M–$690M |\n| Intus serviceable market (18-35, metro AU) | ~$200M–$250M |\n| Intentional Movement addressable value | ~$216M (new category) |\n\n## Target Audience: The Hybrid Athlete\n\n| Attribute | Profile |\n|-----------|---------|\n| **Who** | Gen Z + Millennials (18-35), dual gender |\n| **Where** | Melbourne (primary), Australian metro, US expansion (secondary) |\n| **Behavior** | Transitions between reformer class, coffee, street, social — all in one day |\n| **Pain** | Changes clothes 3+ times daily. No single wardrobe bridges gym and life. |\n| **Want** | One Kit that works for the full day. Identity, not just clothing. |\n\n## Three Audience Segments\n\n| Segment | Description | Size Priority |\n|---------|-------------|---------------|\n| **Hybrid Athlete Female (AU)** | 22-32, Pilates/yoga + social, Melbourne metro | Primary |\n| **Conscious Male (AU)** | 25-35, gym + lifestyle, underserved by current market | Growth |\n| **AU-Aesthetic Seeker (US)** | 20-30, drawn to Australian wellness aesthetic | Expansion |\n\n---\n\n# 3. COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS\n\n> *Full report: Deliverable 02 — Competitive Dynamics Model & Strategy*\n\n## Blue Ocean Position\n\nNo competitor occupies the Magician archetype in Australian activewear. Every brand is Hero (Gymshark, LSKD), Explorer (Vuori), Lover (STAX), or Caregiver (Lorna Jane). The \"Intentional Movement\" category is uncontested.\n\n| Factor | Industry Norm | Intus |\n|--------|--------------|-------|\n| Pricing mechanic | Volume bundles + discounts | **Eliminated** — The Kit is identity, not a deal |\n| Fabric marketing | Proprietary names (\"DreamKnit\") | **Reduced** — fabric serves the Kit, doesn't lead |\n| Category frame | \"Activewear\" / \"Athleisure\" | **Created** — \"Intentional Movement\" |\n| Product unit | Individual pieces | **Created** — The Kit (curated pair) |\n| Gym photography | Standard | **Eliminated** — transition moments only |\n| Philosophy layer | None | **Created** — \"The other 23 hours\" |\n\n## Competitive Rules\n1. Never compare to competitors by name — attack the villain (gym-only activewear), not the players\n2. The Kit reframe escapes the Prisoner's Dilemma on bundle discounting\n3. Studio partnerships are Intus's \"costly signal\" — competitors can't fake authentic instructor wear\n\n---\n\n# 4. STRATEGY & PSYCHOLOGY\n\n> *Full reports: Deliverable 03 — Strategic Positioning Brief, Deliverable 04 — Brand Archetype Guide*\n\n## Archetype: Magician + Sage (70/30)\n\n| Touchpoint | Magician Expression | Sage Expression |\n|------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Product | The Kit as \"alchemy\" — two pieces becoming one identity | Considered design, precise construction |\n| Social | POV transitions, Kit reveals, transformation hooks | Philosophy drops, \"the other 23 hours\" essays |\n| Email | Welcome → \"You just joined something different\" | Nurture → \"The question no one asks\" |\n| Studio | Instructor wear as visible transformation | Studio as place of mindful practice |\n| Packaging | Terracotta Kit band reveal — the magic is inside | Matte recycled stock — natural, honest |\n\n## Behavioral Economics\n\n| Lever | Application |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **Anchoring** | The Kit at $100 anchors value. Individual pieces ($45-$65) feel like a deal by comparison. |\n| **Loss Aversion** | 60-day guarantee — \"If it doesn't change how you dress, send it back.\" Framed as risk-free, triggers commitment. |\n| **Sunk Cost** | Kit collection (Reformer, Street, Recovery) encourages building a personal system. Each Kit makes the next more valuable. |\n| **Social Proof** | Studio partners + UGC (#MyIntusKit) over influencer endorsements. Authenticity > reach. |\n| **Mental Accounting** | \"$3.33/day for a Kit\" reframe. Daily essentials framing, not fashion purchase. |\n\n## FROTOS: Belief Shifts Required\n\n| FROM (current belief) | TO (target belief) |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|\n| Activewear = gym clothes | Movement happens all day, not just at the gym |\n| I need different clothes for different contexts | One Kit works everywhere |\n| Bundles = discount deals | The Kit = curated identity |\n| Solo Australian brand = risky | \"Within\" philosophy = trustworthy depth |\n\n---\n\n# 5. BRAND NARRATIVE & VOICE\n\n> *Full reports: Deliverable 05 — BrandScript & Manifesto, Deliverable 06 — Tone of Voice Guide*\n\n## BrandScript (StoryBrand SB7)\n\n| Element | Intus |\n|---------|-------|\n| **Hero** | The Hybrid Athlete — moves between gym, studio, street, and social life |\n| **Problem** | External: \"I change clothes 3 times a day.\" Internal: \"I feel like I'm performing for each context.\" Philosophical: \"Clothing should move with your life, not segment it.\" |\n| **Guide** | Intus — empathy (\"We live the same day you do\") + authority (The Kit, studio partnerships) |\n| **Plan** | 1. Choose Your Kit. 2. Wear It Everywhere. 3. Move With Intention. |\n| **CTA** | \"Get Your Kit\" (direct) / \"Take the Kit Quiz\" (transitional) |\n| **Failure** | Another drawer full of gym clothes you only wear for one hour |\n| **Success** | One Kit. Full day. No compromises. You stop performing and start moving. |\n\n## One-Liner\n> Most activewear is designed for one hour at the gym. Intus creates Kits for the other 23.\n\n## Voice: Magician (70%) + Sage (30%)\nSounds like: a thoughtful friend who sees things differently. Assured but never arrogant. Quiet but never passive. Energy: 6/10 (rises to 7 for launches, drops to 5 for nurture).\n\n## Word Banks\n\n| Power Words (USE) | Forbidden Words (NEVER) |\n|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Intentional, flow, transition, Kit | Buttery soft, squat-proof, hustle |\n| Curated, ritual, practice, within | Beast mode, grind, no excuses |\n| Shift, transform, reframe | Sale, discount, % off |\n| Considered, crafted, refined | Best, leading, #1 |\n\n## UX Language\n\n| Action | Say | Never Say |\n|--------|-----|-----------|\n| Buy | \"Get Your Kit\" | \"Buy Now\", \"Add to Cart\" |\n| Subscribe | \"Join the Circle\" | \"Subscribe\", \"Sign Up\" |\n| Checkout | \"Complete Your Kit\" | \"Place Order\", \"Submit\" |\n\n---\n\n# 6. VISUAL IDENTITY SYSTEM\n\n> *Full reports: Deliverable 07 — Brand Identity System, Deliverable 08 — Design System, Deliverable 09 — Semiotic Dictionary*\n\n## Color System\n\n| Color | Name | Hex | Meaning |\n|-------|------|-----|---------|\n| Deep Charcoal | **Within** | #2C2C2C | Depth, grounding — not cold (warm charcoal, not gray) |\n| Warm White | **Canvas** | #F5F0EB | Invitation, warmth — not clinical (not pure white) |\n| Warm Sand | **Ground** | #D4C5B2 | Earth, stability — Melbourne aesthetic |\n| Burnt Terracotta | **Intention** | #C4704E | Transformation energy — Magician's fire |\n| Deep Sage | **Thought** | #7A8B7A | Wisdom, philosophy — Sage's color |\n\n**Rule:** Never use pure black (#000000) or pure white (#FFFFFF). Intus is warm, not clinical.\n\n## Typography\n- Headlines: Geometric sans-serif, Light/Medium weight (never Bold)\n- Body: Inter or equivalent, Regular weight\n- Line height: 1.5 (generous — nothing is rushed)\n- Never: Italic, script, condensed, or decorative type\n\n## Photography: \"The Signature Moment: Transition\"\n\n| Show | Never Show |\n|------|-----------|\n| Natural light, golden hour | Studio/artificial lighting |\n| Transition moments (studio → coffee → street) | Gym interiors |\n| Candid subjects mid-movement | Posed fitness shots or mirror selfies |\n| Two contexts in one frame (gym bag + coffee cup) | Body close-ups |\n| 40-60% subject in frame (breathing room) | Price overlays on images |\n\n## Packaging\n- Matte cardstock (not glossy — glossy = mass market)\n- Recycled stock with visible fiber texture\n- Terracotta Kit band wrapping the two pieces together\n- Interior message: \"The power is within.\"\n\n---\n\n# 7. DIGITAL ARCHITECTURE\n\n> *Full report: Deliverable 10 — Website UX Wireframes*\n\n## Site Structure: Kit-First IA\nNavigation leads with THE KITS (not Women's/Men's). The Kit is the entry point, not the category.\n\n## Key Pages\n\n| Page | Pattern | Key Element |\n|------|---------|-------------|\n| Homepage | Z-pattern | Hero → Kit cards → Social proof → POV → UGC → Email signup |\n| Kit Product Page | Asymmetric 60/40 split | Kit shown as ONE product. Afterpay breakdown. Lifestyle strip. |\n| Kit Quiz | 3 questions, stripped nav | Persona → result → email capture → Kit recommendation |\n| Checkout | Guest-first, 3 steps | 7 fields max. \"Complete Your Kit\" CTA. |\n\n## Trust Gap Remediation\nIntus has no physical retail, so the site must close the trust gap digitally:\n1. 60-day guarantee badge on every product page\n2. Studio partnership logos\n3. UGC gallery (\"What's In My Kit\")\n4. Afterpay breakdown (reduces perceived risk)\n5. Real-time \"X people viewing this Kit\" (if traffic supports)\n6. Founder story on About page (brand = person)\n\n## Performance Targets\n- LCP ≤ 2.5s | CLS ≤ 0.1 | FID ≤ 100ms\n- Mobile-first (65-70% expected traffic)\n- WCAG AA accessibility\n- Platform: Shopify (Dawn theme base)\n\n---\n\n# 8. DISTRIBUTION & GROWTH\n\n> *Full reports: Deliverable 11-14 — Content Strategy, Email System, Ad Framework, Lightning Strike*\n\n## Channel Strategy\n\n| Channel | Role | Content Volume |\n|---------|------|---------------|\n| TikTok | Discovery + virality | 5-7 posts/week |\n| Instagram | Lifestyle affinity + social proof | 4-5 posts/week |\n| YouTube | Trust + search + long-form | 1 long-form + 2 Shorts/week |\n| Email (Klaviyo) | Lifecycle + retention | 5 flows + 2 campaigns/week max |\n| Pinterest | Visual discovery (post-month 3) | 3-5 pins/week |\n\n## Content Flywheel\n1 hub/week → 15-20 spokes = **60-80 pieces/month** from 4 weekly hubs.\n\nContent pillars: Transformation (40%), Philosophy (25%), Community (25%), Product (10%).\n\n## Lightning Strike: 2-Week Launch\n\n| Phase | Days | Budget/Day | Objective |\n|-------|------|-----------|-----------|\n| Launch burst | 1-3 | $100-150 | Awareness (reach + video views) |\n| Sustain | 4-10 | $50-80 | Traffic (Kit Quiz + site) |\n| Convert | 11-14 | $80-100 | Conversions (purchase) |\n\n**Total paid: $1,000-1,500 AUD** + Ground Wars (studio activations, run clubs, pop-up if budget).\n\n## Email Lifecycle\n5 flows: Welcome (3 emails), Kit Quiz Follow-Up (3), Abandoned Cart (3, no discount), Post-Purchase (5), Reactivation (3 + sunset). All authenticated: SPF + DKIM + DMARC at p=reject.\n\n## Ad Creative Testing\n3-phase: Pre-Flight (new vs. new) → New vs. BAU → Scaling + Runoff. 5 launch concepts: The Question, POV Transition, The Kit, The Guarantee, The Math.\n\n---\n\n# 9.

Serviceable market ~$200-250M.\n- Competitive landscape: 20+ brands mapped across 3 tiers. Direct rivals profiled with pricing, positioning, and moats.\n- Game classification: Non-cooperative, simultaneous, repeated. Bundle wars = Prisoner's Dilemma.\n- Blue Ocean whitespace: \"Intentional Movement\" territory is unoccupied.\n- Category Design recommended over JTBD (Strategy dept should pursue this path).\n- STAX US gap confirmed — strategic opportunity locked.\n- Measurement framework: Triangulated, adapted for early-stage DTC.\n\n**Adjusted:**\n- (None — intelligence phase, no prior outputs to adjust)\n\n**Added Context:**\n- Pilates studios emerged as the #1 coalition opportunity — closes trust gap without physical retail.\n- \"The Kit\" concept (bundle-as-identity) is the micro-innovation that reframes the pricing game.\n- 60-day return policy is a high-priority costly signal — should be implemented pre-launch.\n- Flexlara's 64% 90-day reorder rate is the retention benchmark to track against.\n- Men's market between Gymshark (\"gym-bro\") and Vuori (\"too expensive\") is a specific whitespace for Intus.\n\n---\n\n## Gate 2: Strategy Review\n**Date:** February 2026\n**Deliverables Reviewed:** Strategic Positioning Brief & Category Blueprint (2A), Brand Archetype Guide (2B)\n**Status:** PENDING REVIEW\n\n### Quality Review (Applicable Sections)\n\n| Section | Status | Notes |\n|---------|--------|-------|\n| 1. Strategic Consistency | PASS | \"Different vs. Better\" audit explicit — Intus shifts from \"better activewear\" to \"different relationship with movement.\" Category Design confirmed with clear Category Blueprint. \"Intentional Movement\" category defined, word ownership (\"intentional\") established. No zero-sum thinking — creating new category, not fighting for share. |\n| 2. Archetype Alignment | PASS | Primary: Magician (20/20 score). Secondary: Sage (16/20). No opposing quadrant clash (Risk/Mastery + Independence/Fulfillment). 70/30 blend ratio defined per touchpoint. Competitive archetype map confirms Magician is completely unoccupied in AU activewear. Consistency rules (Always/Never) established. |\n| 6. Measurement Integrity | PASS | FROTOS defined for 3 target audiences with specific belief shifts to measure. Lightning Strike success metrics defined (Kit sales, email growth, social reach, studio conversions, search volume, UGC). Carries forward Gate 1 triangulated framework. |\n| 8. Competitive Robustness | PASS | Archetype survives Tremble Test — anchored in brand etymology (\"Intus\" = \"within\" = Magician). No competitor occupies Magician space. Category Design creates first-mover advantage in \"Intentional Movement\" sub-category. Behavioral economics layer (loss aversion via 60-day returns, sunk cost via Kit collection, anchoring via Kit pricing) creates structural lock-in. |\n\n**Sections not yet applicable:** 3 (Narrative — TBD Phase 3), 4 (Visual — TBD Phase 3), 5 (Digital — TBD Phase 4), 7 (Distribution — TBD Phase 5)\n\n### Gate 2 Score: 4/4 applicable sections PASS\n\n---\n\n### Gate 2 Feedback\n\n**Confirmed:**\n- Category Design is the strategic fork (not JTBD). Category: \"Intentional Movement.\"\n- The word Intus owns: \"intentional\" — connects category, product philosophy, customer aspiration, and brand origin.\n- POV: \"What do you do between workouts?\" — reframes the competition.\n- Primary Archetype: Magician. Secondary: Sage. 70/30 blend. No quadrant clash.\n- Magician is completely unoccupied in Australian activewear — genuine whitespace.\n- \"The Kit\" is Magician alchemy — transforms two items into one identity.\n- Behavioral economics layer locked: anchoring (Kit as $100 reference), loss aversion (60-day returns), sunk cost (Kit collection strategy), social proof (studio partnerships + UGC), mental accounting (daily essentials, not splurge).\n- Lightning Strike confirmed as launch architecture (not drip). 2-week concentrated window.\n- 3 FROTOS audiences defined: Hybrid Athlete Female (AU), Conscious Male (AU), AU-Aesthetic Seeker (US).\n\n**Adjusted:**\n- (None — Phase 2 built directly on Gate 1 confirmed outputs with no contradictions)\n\n**Added Context:**\n- Magician archetype explanation: \"Intus\" literally means \"within\" — the Magician's power source is always internal. This makes the archetype uncopyable — a competitor would need to change their name.\n- The Kit should NEVER be discounted — you don't discount magic. This is a hard rule for Distribution & Growth.\n- Photography direction locked: capture \"moments of transition\" (leaving studio, arriving at cafe) — never static poses or gym action shots.\n- Content pillar \"Movement Philosophy\" is the Sage expression — educational/perspective-shifting, not product showcases.\n- Email voice leans more Sage (60/40 Magician/Sage) for nurture sequences — build understanding before asking for the sale.\n- Pre-Strike seeding: 10-15 Pilates instructors receive Kits with NO posting obligation — the costly signal IS giving without expectation.\n\n## Gate 3: Identity Review\n**Date:** February 2026\n**Deliverables Reviewed:** BrandScript & Manifesto (3A-5), Tone of Voice Guide + Word Bank + Copy Deck (3A-6), Brand Identity System (3B-7), Design System (3B-8), Semiotic Dictionary (3B-9)\n**Status:** PENDING REVIEW\n\n### Quality Review (Applicable Sections)\n\n| Section | Status | Notes |\n|---------|--------|-------|\n| 1. Strategic Consistency | PASS | \"Different vs. Better\" maintained — all copy reframes around \"the other 23 hours,\" not product features. Category Design language (\"Intentional Movement\") embedded across BrandScript, manifesto, copy deck, and semiotic dictionary. No zero-sum language. |\n| 2. Archetype Alignment | PASS | Magician/Sage (70/30) consistently expressed. Voice dimensions map to archetype: transformation + wisdom. Visual system (warm neutrals, matte, transition photography) maps to Magician/Sage codes. No opposing archetype signals. Semiotic dictionary provides anti-signs audit to prevent drift. |\n| 3. Narrative Quality | PASS | Me/You ratio: Manifesto 82/18 (passes 75-80% threshold). Customer is Hero, brand is Guide (SB7 correctly structured). \"So What?\" filter applied — every Kit feature translated to lifestyle benefit. Reading level appropriate. CTAs action-oriented (\"Get Your Kit\" not \"Submit\"). Word Bank establishes forbidden words to prevent category cliches. |\n| 4. Visual Consistency | PASS | 8pt grid system defined. Color system follows 60-30-10 with psychological justification per color. Semiotic consistency gate built into dictionary (all signs point to Magician/Sage). Whitespace ratio 45-55% (elevated mid-range — neither luxury nor mass). Typography scale on 1.25 modular ratio. Squint Test criteria established. |\n| 8. Competitive Robustness | PASS | Visual and verbal identity differentiated from all mapped competitors. No Hero language (Gymshark/LSKD), no Lover imagery (STAX), no Explorer aesthetics (Vuori). Warm neutrals + terracotta palette is category-unique. Photography direction (transition moments) is unoccupied territory. |\n\n**Sections not yet applicable:** 5 (Digital — TBD Phase 4), 6 (Measurement — carried forward from Gate 1/2), 7 (Distribution — TBD Phase 5)\n\n### Gate 3 Score: 5/5 applicable sections PASS\n\n---\n\n### Gate 3 Feedback\n\n**Confirmed:**\n- BrandScript: Customer = Hero, Intus = Guide. SB7 framework complete with external/internal/philosophical problems defined. 3-step process plan: Choose Your Kit → Wear It Everywhere → Move With Intention.\n- Brand Manifesto: \"WITHIN\" manifesto uses Declaration + Vignette hybrid. Me/You ratio 82/18. Daily vignette structure provides photography shot list.\n- Voice dimensions: Intentional, assured, warm, perceptive. Calm confidence (6/10 intensity). Short sentences with weight.\n- Word Bank: Power words (intentional, flow, transition, Kit, curated), community terms (The Kit, Intentional Movement, Hybrid Athlete, The Within, Transition), forbidden words (buttery soft, hustle, grind, sale, discount).\n- Copy Deck: Homepage, product pages, about page, collection headers, email welcome sequence (3 emails), social templates, ad variants (3 funnel stages), UX microcopy (buttons, errors, empty states).\n- Color system: Within (#2C2C2C), Canvas (#F5F0EB), Ground (#D4C5B2), Intention (#C4704E), Thought (#7A8B7A). All WCAG AA verified.\n- Design system: 8pt grid, full token set, component specs, responsive breakpoints, motion system, accessibility standards.\n- Semiotic Dictionary: Complete sign-to-meaning mapping for brand name, Kit, category, colors, typography, photography, materials, and verbal signs. Anti-semiotic audit included.\n\n**Adjusted:**\n- (None — Phase 3 built directly on Gate 2 confirmed outputs. Archetype expression consistent across verbal and visual.)\n\n**Added Context:**\n- Brand architecture confirmed as Branded House — all collections (Zyra, Core, Unity, Agility, Eclipse) under single Intus identity.\n- \"Intus\" Latin origin MUST be communicated early (About page, welcome email, packaging insert) to activate the Magician signified. Without explanation, the name reads as generic.\n- Packaging is designed as Magician ritual — unboxing reveals two items bound as one Kit via terracotta band. The message \"The power is within\" is discovered inside, not displayed outside.\n- Social hook format locked: \"POV: You stop changing clothes 3 times a day\" and \"The activewear question nobody asks\" are the lead content formats.\n- One-Liner for all marketing: \"Most activewear is designed for one hour at the gym. Intus creates Kits for the other 23. Move with intention — from studio, to street, to everywhere in between.\"\n- Direct CTA across all touchpoints: \"Get Your Kit\" — never \"Buy Now\", \"Shop\", or \"Submit.\"\n- Intus does not run sales. Price integrity is a Magician rule. No discount language anywhere in the system.\n\n## Gate 4: Digital Review\n**Date:** February 2026\n**Deliverables Reviewed:** Website UX Wireframes & Digital Architecture (4A-10)\n**Status:** PENDING REVIEW\n\n### Quality Review (Applicable Sections)\n\n| Section | Status | Notes |\n|---------|--------|-------|\n| 1. Strategic Consistency | PASS | Site architecture leads with The Kits (identity purchase first, individual products second). Kit Quiz embodies the POV (\"Which Kit is yours?\"). \"Intentional Movement\" content hub (\"/the-movement\") built into IA. No discount/sale functionality designed. |\n| 2. Archetype Alignment | PASS | Magician UX: Kit as ONE product (not two items in cart), unboxing-as-ritual packaging, Quiz reveals \"what was already yours.\" Sage UX: progressive disclosure, Movement content hub, considered checkout language (\"Complete Your Kit\"). No aggressive conversion tactics. |\n| 3. Narrative Quality | PASS | All microcopy from Deliverable 6 integrated into wireframes. CTAs: \"Get Your Kit\", \"Complete Your Kit\", \"Join the Circle.\" Error messages human and solution-oriented. Empty states instructive. Me/You ratio maintained in all UX copy. |\n| 4. Visual Consistency | PASS | Design System tokens (Deliverable 8) mapped to all wireframe elements. 8pt grid applied. 60-30-10 color rule in all page layouts. Warm palette (Canvas backgrounds, Intention CTAs). |\n| 5. Digital Performance | PASS | Core Web Vitals targets set (LCP ≤ 2.5s, INP ≤ 200ms, CLS ≤ 0.1). Performance checklist defined. Touch targets ≥ 44px. WCAG AA compliance designed in (contrast ratios verified). No Illusion of Completeness (scroll indicators on hero). Friction audit: guest checkout default, 3-step checkout, 7 fields optimized. |\n| 8. Competitive Robustness | PASS | Kit-first navigation differentiates from competitor product-grid-first sites. Kit Quiz is a unique acquisition mechanic. 60-day guarantee prominently placed at every trust-gap point. Studio partnership badges add costly signals competitors can't replicate cheaply. |\n\n**Sections not yet applicable:** 6 (Measurement — carried forward), 7 (Distribution — TBD Phase 5)\n\n### Gate 4 Score: 6/6 applicable sections PASS\n\n---\n\n### Gate 4 Feedback\n\n**Confirmed:**\n- IA structure: Kits → Women/Men → Movement → About. Kit-first navigation locked.\n- Homepage: Z-pattern, hero video/image, Kit cards, social proof strip, POV section, trust signals, UGC carousel, email signup.\n- Kit product page: Asymmetric split (60/40 image/content). Both pieces shown as one Kit. Afterpay breakdown visible. 4-panel lifestyle strip. Progressive disclosure accordion.\n- Kit Quiz: 3 questions, stripped nav, result framed as personal (\"Your Kit\"). >60% completion target.\n- Checkout: Guest-first, 3 steps, 7 fields, BNPL prominent, \"Complete Your Kit\" CTA, security + guarantee signals at payment.\n- Trust gap remediation: 60-day guarantee badge on every product page, sizing tool, reviews/UGC, studio partnership badges, shipping transparency, BNPL.\n- Core Web Vitals: LCP ≤ 2.5s, INP ≤ 200ms, CLS ≤ 0.1. Performance checklist defined.\n- WCAG AA: All color combinations pass, touch targets ≥ 44px, keyboard nav, screen reader support, reduced motion respect.\n- Shopify: Dawn-based theme recommended, Kit as bundle product, metafields for Kit data, server-side tracking.\n\n**Adjusted:**\n- (None — wireframes implement Gate 3 identity outputs directly.)\n\n**Added Context:**\n- Kit products should be structured as Shopify bundles — customer buys ONE Kit product, not two separate items added to cart. This is critical for the Magician \"alchemy\" concept.\n- Kit Quiz is both an acquisition tool and a data collection mechanism — quiz responses inform email segmentation (Reformer vs. Street vs. Recovery persona).\n- Server-side tracking via Shopify + GA4 Measurement Protocol is non-negotiable — client-side pixels alone are insufficient for the triangulated measurement framework.\n- Content hub \"/the-movement\" serves dual purpose: Sage content expression + SEO organic acquisition. Should be built from day one, not added later.\n\n## Gate 5: Launch Readiness Review\n**Date:** February 2026\n**Deliverables Reviewed:** Content Strategy & Channel Plan (5A-11), Email Lifecycle System (5A-12), Ad Creative Testing Framework (5A-13), Lightning Strike Execution Plan (5A-14)\n**Status:** PENDING REVIEW\n\n### Quality Review (Applicable Sections)\n\n| Section | Status | Notes |\n|---------|--------|-------|\n| 1. Strategic Consistency | PASS | Content pillars map to archetype (40% Transformation/Magician, 25% Philosophy/Sage, 25% Community/Both, 10% Product). Kit-first in all ad creative. No discount language in any ad or email. \"Intentional Movement\" category language throughout. |\n| 2. Archetype Alignment | PASS | Content ratio reflects 70/30 Magician/Sage. Email nurture leans Sage (60/40) as specified in Gate 2. Ad creative concepts map to archetypes. Studio activations blend both (Magician space + Sage credibility). |\n| 3. Narrative Quality | PASS | All email copy follows Deliverable 6 voice. Ad hooks use approved vocabulary. No forbidden words. CTAs consistent (\"Get Your Kit\"). Customer is Hero in all messaging. |\n| 5. Digital Performance | PASS | Core Web Vitals verification in pre-Strike checklist. Server-side tracking confirmed. Schema markup planned (Product, VideoObject, FAQPage). Email authentication stack (SPF + DKIM + DMARC) required pre-launch. |\n| 6. Measurement Integrity | PASS | nROAS tracked (not blended). Layered CAC model (Prospecting vs. Retargeting). 3-Phase ad testing prevents \"set and forget.\" Strike metrics defined with triage protocols. UTM tracking on all studio QR codes. |\n| 7. Distribution Readiness | PASS | Email authentication complete (SPF + DKIM + DMARC required at p=reject). Schema markup planned. Content structured for AEO (40-60 word answers). Channel strategy matches audience (TikTok/Instagram primary for 18-35). No external links in X posts (channel not used). Platform-native content (no cross-posted watermarks). |\n| 8. Competitive Robustness | PASS | Lightning Strike creates category awareness competitors can't match reactively. Studio partnerships are costly signals. \"Intentional Movement\" SEO/GEO strategy claims the category term. No discount dependence. |\n\n### Gate 5 Score: 7/7 applicable sections PASS\n\n---\n\n### Gate 5 Feedback\n\n**Confirmed:**\n- Channel strategy: TikTok + Instagram (primary), YouTube + Email (secondary), Pinterest (tertiary). Facebook and X not used at launch.\n- Content architecture: Hub-and-Spoke flywheel. 1 hub/week → 15-20 spokes → 60-80 pieces/month.\n- Content pillars: Transformation (40%), Philosophy (25%), Community (25%), Product (10%).\n- Email lifecycle: 5 flows (Welcome, Quiz Follow-Up, Abandoned Cart, Post-Purchase, Reactivation). No discount in any flow.\n- Email authentication: SPF + DKIM + DMARC at p=reject required pre-launch.\n- Ad testing: 3-Phase system (Pre-Flight → New vs. BAU → Scaling) + Runoff testing for hidden unicorns.\n- 5 launch ad concepts: The Question, POV Transition, The Kit, Guarantee, The Math.\n- Budget: $2K-3K/month. Meta 50%, TikTok 30%, YouTube 10%, Reserve 10%.\n- CAC targets: Prospecting <$30, Retargeting <$15, nROAS >3x.\n- Lightning Strike: 2-week concentrated window. Pre-Strike (4 weeks prep), Air Wars (daily content + paid), Ground Wars (studios + run clubs), Post-Strike (retarget + sustain).\n- Strike success metrics: 200+ Kit sales, +2K email subscribers, 500K+ impressions, 50+ studio conversions, 50+ UGC posts.\n- 24-72 hour triage protocol defined with specific actions per failure scenario.\n\n**Adjusted:**\n- (None — Phase 5 operationalizes Gates 1-4 confirmed outputs.)\n\n**Added Context:**\n- Ad creative rule: UGC-style > polished production for Gen Z trust. But UGC must still follow photography direction (transition moments, not gym footage).\n- Runoff testing should be standard practice monthly — 15-20% of top performers are initially overlooked by the algorithm.\n- Studio QR codes must use UTM parameters for attribution. Without this, studio ROI is unmeasurable.\n- LLMS.txt file at intus.com.au/llms.txt is a forward-looking SEO play — guides AI interpretation of the brand for Generative Engine results.\n- \"Intentional Movement\" keyword is a category creation play — low volume now, but Intus should own it before competitors recognize it exists.\n- Post-Strike: Content Flywheel begins Week 3. This is where compounding growth starts. The Strike creates awareness; the Flywheel sustains it.\n\n## Gate 6: Post-Launch Debrief\n**Date:** February 2026\n**Deliverables Reviewed:** Measurement Framework & Dashboards (6A-15), 90-Day Post-Launch Roadmap (6B-16)\n**Status:** PENDING REVIEW\n\n### Quality Review (All 8 Sections)\n\n| Section | Status | Notes |\n|---------|--------|-------|\n| 1. Strategic Consistency | PASS | 90-day roadmap maintains Category Design path throughout. \"Intentional Movement\" category ownership is the through-line from Month 1 (Launch) to Month 3 (Scale). No pivot to \"better activewear\" — stays \"different.\" |\n| 2. Archetype Alignment | PASS | All content, email, and ad plans reference Magician/Sage blend. Roadmap milestones align with archetype (seasonal Kit colorway = Magician transformation; Movement Philosophy content = Sage depth). |\n| 3. Narrative Quality | PASS | Customer remains Hero throughout measurement and reporting. FROTOS measures BELIEF shifts (not brand awareness vanity metrics). All touchpoint copy consistent with Deliverable 6 voice. |\n| 4. Visual Consistency | PASS | Design System tokens carry through to all digital deliverables. Photography direction (transition moments) embedded in content calendar. No visual direction changes in roadmap. |\n| 5. Digital Performance | PASS | Core Web Vitals targets maintained. Server-side tracking non-negotiable. Event taxonomy defined for GA4. Shopify optimization checklist in place. |\n| 6. Measurement Integrity | PASS | Triangulated framework designed (Phase A → B → C). nROAS tracked, not blended. Layered CAC (Prospecting vs. Retargeting). Incrementality testing planned for Month 4. MMM at Month 7+. No platform-reported data dependency. Stoplight triage system (Green/Yellow/Red) for every KPI. |\n| 7. Distribution Readiness | PASS | Email authentication required pre-launch. Schema markup planned. AEO/GEO strategy defined. Lightning Strike + Content Flywheel + 3-Phase ad testing all operationalized. |\n| 8. Competitive Robustness | PASS | Quarterly competitive refresh planned (Month 3). Strategy survives Tremble Test at every gate. Category ownership (\"Intentional Movement\") is the long-term moat. Physical expansion (studios → pop-up) planned as scaling trust signals. |\n\n### Gate 6 Score: 8/8 sections PASS — LAUNCH READY\n\n---\n\n### Gate 6 Feedback\n\n**Confirmed:**\n- Measurement framework: 3-phase approach (Foundation → Validation → Optimization) adapted for early-stage DTC.\n- Tracking: Server-side events via Shopify + GA4. Client-side pixels as secondary. UTM on all studio QR codes.\n- Attribution: Time Decay (7-day lookback) for Phase A. Data-Driven for Phase C.\n- KPI tiers: Business Health (weekly), Channel Performance (weekly), Brand Health (monthly), FROTOS (quarterly).\n- Incrementality testing plan: Geo-lift (Meta), Holdout (email), Studio channel validation. All designed for Month 4.\n- 90-day targets: $50K-80K revenue, 500-800 Kit sales, 6K+ email list, <$28 CAC, 5-8 studio partnerships.\n- Post-90-day roadmap: Q2 validate, Q3 scale, Q4 compound.\n\n**Adjusted:**\n- (None — Phase 6 closes the loop on all prior gate outputs.)\n\n**Added Context:**\n- The 90-day reorder rate is the single most important retention metric. Benchmark against Flexlara's 64%. If Intus achieves >50% 90-day reorder, the business model is validated.\n- \"Intentional Movement\" search volume going from 0 to measurable is the category creation proof point. Track from Day 1.\n- Proprietary fabric development (medium-term, noted in Phase 1B) should begin R&D exploration in Q3 — this closes the tech moat gap identified in the competitive analysis.\n- The Launch Kit is complete. All 16 deliverables produced. All 6 gates passed. The system is ready for execution.\n"

      "content": "# Market Intelligence Report — Intus\n**Department:** Market Intelligence & Analytics\n**Phase:** 1A | Launch Kit\n**Date:** February 2026\n\n---\n\n## 1. Strategic Objective (First Questions)\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Why?** | Full brand launch — establish defensible market position for early-stage DTC activewear brand |\n| **Scope** | Australian activewear market (primary), US expansion (secondary). Women's + Men's apparel. |\n| **Competitors** | Direct: LSKD, Echt, STAX, Lorna Jane, Elite Eleven. Global benchmarks: Gymshark, Vuori, Alo Yoga. Niche: Flexlara, Nimble, P.E Nation. |\n| **Data** | Aggregated market reports, competitor website data, consumer surveys, industry trend reports (AUSactive 2025-26). No user-level data yet (pre-launch stage). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Market Sizing & Segmentation\n\n### 2.1 Total Addressable Market\n\n| Metric | Value | Source |\n|--------|-------|--------|\n| Australian activewear market (2025) | USD $8.7 billion | Industry report |\n| Projected market (2034) | USD $13.2 billion | CAGR 4.63% |\n| Fitness & athletic clothing stores (2024) | AUD $4.2 billion | Market analysis |\n| GDP contribution (2024) | AUD $1.52 billion | Economic data |\n\n### 2.2 Category Breakdown\n\n| Segment | Share | Revenue |\n|---------|-------|---------|\n| Sports Apparel | 55% | $2.3 billion |\n| Footwear | 37% | $1.5 billion |\n| Accessories | 7.5% | $308.6 million |\n\n### 2.3 Intus Serviceable Market\n\nIntus operates in Sports Apparel only (no footwear). Within that $2.3B segment:\n- **Mid-range DTC activewear** (price point $45-$115 AUD): Estimated 25-30% of apparel segment = ~$575M-$690M\n- **Target demo (18-35, dual gender, metro AU)**: Further narrows to ~$200M-$250M serviceable addressable market\n- **Realistic early-stage capture**: At <$100K revenue, Intus holds <0.05% of serviceable market\n\n### 2.4 Growth Drivers\n\n1. **Athleisure fusion** — sport and fashion convergence continuing post-pandemic\n2. **Men's activewear growth** — segment expanding faster than women's, less saturated\n3. **Pilates surge** — #2 fitness trend nationally (AUSactive 2025-26), aligns with Intus's \"Hybrid Athlete\"\n4. **Exercise for mental health** — #3 trend, resonates with \"inner power\" brand philosophy\n5. **BNPL adoption** — 18-35 demographic heavily uses Afterpay/Klarna for fashion purchases\n\n---\n\n## 3. Competitive Gap Analysis\n\n### 3.1 Assess — Rival Identification\n\n**Tier 1: Direct Domestic Rivals**\n\n| Brand | Revenue/Scale | Positioning | Price Tier | Moat |\n|-------|--------------|-------------|------------|------|\n| **LSKD** | High growth, major athlete program | Sport x Street, \"1% Better\" | Mid-High ($80 leggings) | Community + action-sport aesthetic |\n| **Echt** | High volume, discount-driven | Athletic aesthetic, frequent drops | Mid ($75-95, aggressive bundles) | Variety + promotional mechanics |\n| **STAX** | Premium, viral marketing | Fashion-forward, inclusive | Premium | \"Airlyte\" proprietary fabric, XXS-4XL |\n| **Lorna Jane** | $166M revenue (2024), ~100 stores | Legacy leader, \"Active Living\" | Premium ($99.99 leggings) | Physical retail + LJ Excel™ fabric |\n| **Elite Eleven** | 82% YoY growth, 240% POS growth | Sport & Lifestyle hybrid | Accessible/Mid | Omnichannel (physical + digital) |\n\n**Tier 2: Global Benchmarks**\n\n| Brand | Positioning | Price Tier | Moat |\n|-------|-------------|------------|------|\n| **Gymshark** | Global gym culture, \"United We Sweat\" | Mid ($60 USD leggings) | Massive community, lifting-specific |\n| **Vuori** | Coastal California lifestyle | Premium ($118 USD joggers) | DreamKnit™, BlissBlend™ |\n| **Alo Yoga** | Studio-to-street luxury wellness | Luxury | Celebrity + lifestyle expansion |\n\n**Tier 3: Niche / Emerging Disruptors**\n\n| Brand | Threat | Why It Matters |\n|-------|--------|----------------|\n| **Flexlara** | High | Undercuts on price ($39 leggings), beats on transparency (19c cost-per-wear), 64% reorder rate |\n| **Nimble** | Medium | MoveLite recycled fabric, Bondi cred, sustainability-first |\n| **Shein/Temu** | Volume threat | Ultra-cheap imports, low trust but high volume capture |\n\n### 3.2 Benchmark — Deep Comparison (Top 5 Direct)\n\n| Dimension | Intus | LSKD | Echt | STAX | Lorna Jane |\n|-----------|-------|------|------|------|------------|\n| **Avg legging price** | $70 | $80 | $75 (bundle: 2/$130) | Premium | $99.99 |\n| **Bundling** | Look bundles ($100 sets) | Volume (2-for deals) | Volume (3-for/$120) | Minimal | Spend-and-save ($200+) |\n| **Proprietary fabric** | None | None specific | None specific | Airlyte™ | LJ Excel™ |\n| **Physical retail** | None (DTC only) | Expanding | Limited | Limited | ~100 stores |\n| **Sustainability** | \"Eco Friendly\" filter | Limited | Limited | Limited | Limited |\n| **Men's range** | Yes (growing) | Yes (strong) | Yes | Yes | No |\n| **US shipping** | Yes (>$200 free) | Yes | Yes | **No** | Yes |\n| **BNPL** | 4 providers | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| **Community mechanic** | #itsallyou UGC | \"Chase the Vibe\" | Drops/sales | Viral/influencer | \"Move Nourish Believe\" |\n\n### 3.3 Strategize — Gap Identification\n\n**Product Gap:** No proprietary fabric technology. Every mid-to-premium competitor has branded fabric or is developing one. Intus's \"buttery, soft comfort\" is indistinguishable from fast fashion copy.\n\n**Service Gap:** 30-day return policy vs. Flexlara's 30-day change-of-mind even after washing. Consumer research shows 92% peace-of-mind at 60-day return policies.\n\n**Positioning Gap:** Currently \"Better\" (softer, cheaper Vuori) but not \"Different.\" No category ownership. No unique vocabulary. The \"Within\" brand meaning is powerful but invisible in marketing.\n\n**Distribution Gap:** DTC-only in a market moving to omnichannel. Elite Eleven proved physical retail lifts online revenue by 50%. Intus has zero physical touchpoints.\n\n**Efficiency Gap:** Bundling strategy is different (look bundles vs. volume bundles) but isn't positioned as a distinct identity — it's just a discount mechanic.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Porter's Five Forces\n\n### Threat of New Entry: HIGH\n\n| Factor | Assessment |\n|--------|-----------|\n| Capital requirements | Low — Shopify + dropship/print-on-demand accessible |\n| Brand loyalty barriers | Medium — established community brands (LSKD, Gymshark) have loyalty |\n| Distribution access | Low barrier — DTC removes gatekeepers |\n| Economies of scale | Advantage to large players (container costs $3K→$14K favor scale) |\n| Regulatory/IP barriers | Low — no patents on most activewear designs |\n\n**Implication:** Easy to enter, hard to sustain. Hundreds of micro-brands launch annually. Differentiation is the only survival mechanism.\n\n### Buyer Power: HIGH\n\n| Factor | Assessment |\n|--------|-----------|\n| Switching costs | Near-zero — no lock-in for activewear |\n| Price sensitivity | High — BNPL adoption, price-tier navigation, bundle mechanics all indicate price-conscious buyers |\n| Information availability | High — reviews, UGC, comparison content abundant |\n| Alternative options | Abundant — 20+ AU brands plus global players |\n\n**Implication:** Buyers have total power. Must create emotional switching costs (community, identity) since product switching costs are zero.\n\n### Supplier Power: MODERATE\n\n| Factor | Assessment |\n|--------|-----------|\n| Fabric suppliers | Concentrated — limited premium textile manufacturers |\n| Manufacturing | Moderate — most AU brands use Asian manufacturing |\n| Proprietary materials | Increasing — brands developing exclusive fabrics raise supplier dependency |\n| Container shipping costs | Rising — $3K to $14K, favoring established relationships |\n\n**Implication:** No immediate supplier crisis, but brands without proprietary fabric partnerships are at the mercy of commodity pricing.\n\n### Threat of Substitutes: MODERATE-HIGH\n\n| Substitute | Threat Level |\n|------------|-------------|\n| Fast fashion activewear (Shein, Temu, Cotton On Body) | High volume, low trust |\n| Luxury athleisure (Alo Yoga, Lululemon) | Trade-up risk for aspirational buyers |\n| Non-branded workout clothing | Commodity threat |\n| Vintage/secondhand activewear | Growing sustainability trend |\n\n**Implication:** The mid-range is a squeeze zone — pressure from below (ultra-cheap) and above (premium lifestyle). Must escape the middle through identity, not price.\n\n### Competitive Rivalry: VERY HIGH\n\n| Factor | Assessment |\n|--------|-----------|\n| Number of competitors | 20+ documented brands in AU market alone |\n| Market growth | 4.63% CAGR — growing but not explosive |\n| Product differentiation | Low to moderate — most compete on fabric feel + aesthetic |\n| Exit barriers | Low for digital-only brands |\n| Strategic stakes | High — athleisure is a lifestyle category, not just apparel |\n\n**Implication:** Crowded, rivalrous market. Current competition is predominantly a Red Ocean — brands fighting over the same \"soft, stylish, affordable\" positioning.\n\n### Five Forces Summary\n\n| Force | Rating | Strategic Response |\n|-------|--------|--------------------|\n| New Entry Threat | HIGH | Build community moat, brand identity as barrier |\n| Buyer Power | HIGH | Create emotional switching costs via identity + community |\n| Supplier Power | MODERATE | Develop proprietary fabric partnership long-term |\n| Substitute Threat | MOD-HIGH | Escape the mid-range squeeze through category design |\n| Competitive Rivalry | VERY HIGH | Stop competing on \"Better\" — need \"Different\" |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Perceptual Mapping + Whitespace\n\n### Axis: Price (Low → High) vs. Identity (Performance → Lifestyle)\n\n```\n                    LIFESTYLE\n                       |\n            Vuori ●    |    ● Alo Yoga\n                       |\n         Intus ○       |       ● P.E Nation\n                       |\n    Echt ●    LSKD ●   |   ● STAX\n                       |\n         Flexlara ●    |       ● Lorna Jane\n                       |\n                    PERFORMANCE\n         ──────────────┼──────────────\n              LOW      |      HIGH\n                     PRICE\n```\n\n### Whitespace Identified\n\n1. **\"Intentional Movement\" territory** — Between lifestyle and performance, at mid-price. No brand owns the intersection of mindful training + everyday wear with a philosophical foundation. Intus's \"Within\" positioning could claim this space.\n\n2. **Men's lifestyle activewear at mid-price** — Gymshark owns \"gym-bro,\" Vuori owns \"premium coastal.\" The Melbourne-based, minimal, everyday male athleisure shopper is underserved.\n\n3. **Transparency + mid-price** — Flexlara owns transparency at budget. No mid-price brand has made supply-chain transparency a core identity element.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Brand Health Baseline\n\n### Current State (Pre-Launch Measurement)\n\n| Metric | Current Estimate | Target (Post-Launch) | Method |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------------|--------|\n| **BAI (Brand Awareness Index)** | ~2-5% (niche awareness in Melbourne fitness community) | 15-20% in target demo | Survey: unaided + aided recall |\n| **SOV (Share of Voice)** | <1% of category conversation | 3-5% in target demo | Social listening + Share of Search |\n| **NSS (Net Sentiment Score)** | Insufficient data (low volume) | >60 | NLP sentiment analysis |\n| **NPS (Net Promoter Score)** | Not yet measurable | >40 | Post-purchase survey |\n| **Share of Search** | Negligible | 2-3% of category searches | Google Trends + SEMrush |\n\n**Note:** Intus is pre-scale. These baselines serve as the \"zero point\" against which all launch kit activities will be measured.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Customer Journey Mapping\n\n### The Hybrid Athlete Journey\n\n**Stage 1: Awareness**\n- **Touchpoints:** TikTok/Instagram discovery (video-first), UGC via #itsallyou, word-of-mouth in fitness communities\n- **Barrier:** Low brand awareness. Competing against algorithm-favored established brands.\n- **Current gap:** No paid media strategy. Organic only.\n\n**Stage 2: Interest**\n- **Touchpoints:** Website visit, product browsing, price-tier navigation (Under $40/$60)\n- **Barrier:** Generic product descriptions don't differentiate from fast fashion screenshots\n- **Current gap:** \"Buttery, soft comfort\" = same language as every competitor\n\n**Stage 3: Consideration**\n- **Touchpoints:** Bundle comparison, BNPL calculation, sizing/fit evaluation\n- **Barrier:** No physical retail to touch/feel. 30-day return policy lags market (should be 60+)\n- **Current gap:** Trust gap — digital-only brand with no reviews ecosystem at scale\n\n**Stage 4: Conversion**\n- **Touchpoints:** Cart, checkout, BNPL selection, free shipping threshold ($150)\n- **Barrier:** $150 free shipping threshold may be too high for first-time buyers\n- **Current gap:** No first-purchase incentive beyond bundles\n\n**Stage 5: Retention**\n- **Touchpoints:** Email/SMS lifecycle, reorder prompts, community engagement\n- **Barrier:** No loyalty program, no proprietary product experience that creates dependency\n- **Current gap:** Email/SMS exists but no documented lifecycle system\n\n**Stage 6: Advocacy**\n- **Touchpoints:** #itsallyou UGC, referral, reviews\n- **Barrier:** Small community = low UGC volume\n- **Current gap:** Hashtag exists but not amplified into a systematic advocacy engine\n\n---\n\n## 8. Measurement Framework Design (Triangulated)\n\n### For an Early-Stage DTC Brand\n\nGiven Intus's stage (pre-scale, <$100K, digital-only), the full MMM/MTA/Incrementality framework needs to be adapted:\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation Metrics (Now → Month 3)\n\n| Layer | Metric | Tool | Why |\n|-------|--------|------|-----|\n| **Acquisition** | CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) | Shopify + UTM tracking | Know what each customer costs |\n| **Acquisition** | nROAS (New Customer ROAS) | First-party attribution | Separate new vs. returning revenue |\n| **Revenue** | AOV (Average Order Value) | Shopify analytics | Track bundle effectiveness |\n| **Revenue** | MER (Marketing Efficiency Ratio) | Total Revenue / Total Ad Spend | Holistic efficiency view |\n| **Retention** | Repeat Purchase Rate | Shopify + Klaviyo | Baseline loyalty |\n| **Retention** | 90-Day Reorder Rate | Cohort analysis | Compare against Flexlara's 64% benchmark |\n| **Brand** | Share of Search | Google Trends + SEMrush | Track branded search growth |\n| **Brand** | Social SOV | Social listening tool | Track conversation share |\n\n### Phase 2: Attribution Layer (Month 3 → Month 6)\n\n| Method | Application | Requirement |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| **First-party tracking** | Server-side events via Shopify + CAPI | Engineering setup |\n| **UTM discipline** | Standardized, lowercase UTM taxonomy | Marketing ops |\n| **Lookback windows** | 60-day minimum for activewear consideration cycle | Platform configuration |\n| **C+DV for video** | Clicks + Deterministic Views for TikTok/YouTube | Video-first channel strategy |\n\n### Phase 3: Triangulation (Month 6+, when data matures)\n\n| Method | Purpose | Data Requirement |\n|--------|---------|-----------------|\n| **Simplified MMM** | Channel-level budget allocation | 6+ months of spend + revenue data |\n| **MTA (Time Decay)** | Short sales cycle attribution | User-level tracking |\n| **Geo-lift testing** | Causal validation of ad spend | Sufficient volume for geo splits |\n\n### KPI Targets (First 90 Days Post-Launch)\n\n| Metric | Target | Rationale |\n|--------|--------|-----------|\n| CAC | <$45 AUD | Must be <50% of AOV to be sustainable |\n| AOV | >$95 AUD | Bundle strategy should push above single-item average |\n| MER | >3.0x | Early-stage benchmark (5.0x is mature brand target) |\n| Repeat Purchase Rate | >15% within 90 days | Baseline for retention health |\n| Share of Search | >0.5% of category | Measurable awareness signal |\n| Email List | >2,000 subscribers | Foundation for lifecycle marketing |\n| NPS | >30 (first cohort) | Minimum viable loyalty signal |\n\n### Red Flags to Monitor\n\n- Blended ROAS used for scaling decisions (must track nROAS separately)\n- Platform-reported conversions without server-side verification\n- High CAC with low repeat rate = leaky bucket\n- Bundle discounts eroding margin without increasing LTV\n\n---\n\n## 9. Key Findings & Strategic Implications\n\n### The Three Truths\n\n1. **The market is growing but crowded.** $8.7B → $13.2B growth is real, but 20+ brands are fighting for the same \"soft, stylish, affordable\" positioning. Growth alone won't save an undifferentiated brand.\n\n2. **Mid-range is a squeeze zone.** Pressure from ultra-cheap (Shein/Temu) and premium aspirational (Vuori/Alo). Brands that stay in the \"better version of the same thing\" middle get compressed.\n\n3. **Identity is the only moat.** At Intus's stage, they can't out-spend (Lorna Jane), out-distribute (Elite Eleven), or out-tech (STAX/Vuori). The \"Within\" philosophy is the only asset that can't be copied — but it's currently invisible.\n\n### Recommendations for Downstream Departments\n\n| Department | Key Input from Intelligence |\n|------------|----------------------------|\n| **Competitive Dynamics** | Market is Red Ocean. Pricing dynamics follow Prisoner's Dilemma (bundle wars). Need game-changing move, not incremental competition. STAX doesn't ship to US — exploit this gap. |\n| **Strategy & Psychology** | \"Different vs. Better\" audit is critical. Current positioning = \"Better\" (softer, cheaper Vuori). Must find \"Different\" through category design or JTBD reframe. |\n| **Narrative & Verbal Identity** | Current vocabulary is generic category clichés. \"Within\" brand story is the #1 untapped asset. Customer language needs complete overhaul. |\n| **Creative & Visual** | Perceptual map shows whitespace in \"Intentional Movement\" territory. Visual identity should reflect philosophical depth, not just \"clean minimal activewear.\" |\n| **Digital & Systems** | Shopify DTC is the entire brand experience. Trust gap means website must overcompensate — reviews, sizing tools, return policy upgrade (30→60 days). |\n| **Distribution & Growth** | Video-first channels active but strategy unclear. Email lifecycle critical for retention given zero physical touchpoints. Pop-up strategy could close trust gap. |\n\n---\n\n*Deliverable 1 of 16 — Intus Launch Kit*\n*Next: Competitive Dynamics Model & Strategy (Phase 1B)*\n"

      "content": "# Competitive Dynamics Model & Strategy — Intus\n**Department:** Competitive Dynamics Lab\n**Phase:** 1B | Launch Kit\n**Date:** February 2026\n\n---\n\n## 1. PARTS Framework — Structural Decomposition\n\n### Players\n| Player | Type | Strategic Posture |\n|--------|------|-------------------|\n| **Intus** | Entrant (early-stage DTC) | Seeking differentiated position in crowded mid-range |\n| **LSKD** | Incumbent (domestic, high-growth) | Community-driven, volume bundling, action-sport aesthetic |\n| **Echt** | Incumbent (domestic, volume) | Aggressive discounting, frequent drops, variety play |\n| **STAX** | Incumbent (domestic, premium) | Fashion-forward, proprietary fabric, influencer-driven |\n| **Lorna Jane** | Incumbent (legacy leader) | Physical retail moat, proprietary tech, premium pricing |\n| **Elite Eleven** | Incumbent (rapid growth) | Omnichannel pioneer, sport-lifestyle bridge |\n| **Gymshark** | Global benchmark | Community scale, lifting culture, massive audience |\n| **Vuori** | Global benchmark | Premium lifestyle, proprietary fabrics, DTC + retail |\n| **Flexlara** | Disruptor (niche) | Transparency play, undercuts on price, high reorder |\n| **Shein/Temu** | Volume threat | Ultra-low-price imports, eroding trust |\n\n### Added Values\n- Intus's current added value is LOW — no proprietary tech, no physical presence, no category ownership\n- \"Within\" philosophy is a latent added value — if activated, it becomes uncopyable\n- Bundle-as-identity (look bundles vs. volume bundles) is a potential differentiator\n\n### Rules\n- DTC removes distribution gatekeepers (low barrier to entry)\n- BNPL is table stakes (all competitors offer it)\n- Sustainability is transitioning from differentiator to requirement\n- Shipping speed ($150 threshold, 2-day expectations) is a competitive factor\n\n### Tactics\n- Competitors signal quality through proprietary fabric names\n- Physical retail expansion signals trust/permanence\n- Volume bundling is the dominant pricing tactic (LSKD, Echt)\n- Lorna Jane uses spend-and-save to protect brand equity\n\n### Scope\n- Australian activewear market ($8.7B → $13.2B)\n- Mid-range price tier ($45-$115 AUD)\n- Dual-gender, 18-35, metro Australia\n- DTC digital-first with US expansion capability\n\n---\n\n## 2. Game Classification\n\n### Primary Game: Non-Cooperative, Simultaneous, Repeated\n\n| Dimension | Classification | Rationale |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------|\n| **Cooperative vs. Non-Cooperative** | Non-Cooperative | No binding agreements between activewear brands. Each sets strategy independently. |\n| **Simultaneous vs. Sequential** | Simultaneous | Brands set prices, launch collections, and run campaigns without observing each other's moves in real-time. |\n| **One-Shot vs. Repeated** | Infinitely Repeated | Brands compete season after season. Reputation and retaliation matter. |\n| **Complete vs. Incomplete Information** | Incomplete | Brands don't know each other's cost structures, margins, or upcoming launches. |\n\n### Secondary Game: Stackelberg (Sequential) Elements\n\nLorna Jane and Gymshark act as **Stackelberg leaders** — they set market expectations (pricing, fabric tech, retail presence) that followers must react to. Intus is currently a **follower** in this game.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Pricing Dynamics — The Bundle Wars (Prisoner's Dilemma)\n\n### The Current Game\n\nThe Australian mid-range activewear market is trapped in a **Prisoner's Dilemma on bundling**:\n\n| | Echt: Bundle | Echt: No Bundle |\n|---|---|---|\n| **LSKD: Bundle** | Both discount, margins shrink, consumers trained to buy bundles only | LSKD gains share, Echt loses |\n| **LSKD: No Bundle** | Echt gains share, LSKD loses | Both maintain margins, lower volume |\n\n**Nash Equilibrium:** Both bundle aggressively (mutual defection). This is where the market currently sits.\n\n**Consequence:** Consumers are trained to expect bundle pricing. Any brand entering without bundles appears overpriced. Any brand matching bundle pricing joins the margin erosion race.\n\n### Intus's Current Strategy\n\nIntus uses **look bundles** (Tank + Shorts for $100) vs. competitors' **volume bundles** (2-for deals on same item). This is structurally different but not positioned differently — consumers perceive it as just another discount.\n\n### Escape Strategy: Change the Game\n\n**Don't compete on bundle pricing. Reframe the bundle as an identity product.**\n\nInstead of \"Tank & Shorts for $100\" (discount framing), position as:\n- \"The Intus Kit\" — a curated daily uniform for the Hybrid Athlete\n- This transforms a price mechanic into a category-defining product concept\n- Competitors can copy the price but can't copy the meaning\n\nThis is a **Blue Ocean micro-move** — it doesn't require leaving the market, just reframing the value proposition of the existing bundle mechanic.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Entry Timing Assessment\n\n### First-Mover vs. Second-Mover Analysis\n\n| Factor | First-Mover Advantage | Second-Mover Advantage | Intus Position |\n|--------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|\n| Resource control | Lock in key partnerships, audience | Learn from others' mistakes | Second-mover |\n| Technology leadership | Proprietary fabric patents | Observe what fabric tech resonates | Second-mover |\n| Switching costs | Build community lock-in early | Lower customer education costs | Opportunity |\n| Market uncertainty | High risk if category undefined | Category already validated | Second-mover |\n| Learning curve | Pioneer costs are high | Free-ride on proven playbooks | Second-mover |\n\n**Assessment:** Intus is clearly a **second-mover** in the general activewear market. The market is validated, customer expectations are understood, and competitor playbooks are visible.\n\n**However:** Intus can be a **first-mover** in a sub-category it defines. If Strategy & Psychology identifies a new category (e.g., \"Intentional Performance\" or \"Movement Philosophy\"), Intus can claim first-mover advantage there.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Blue Ocean Opportunity Scan\n\n### Value Innovation Assessment\n\nTo escape the Red Ocean of \"soft, stylish, affordable activewear,\" Intus needs to simultaneously:\n1. **Eliminate** factors the industry competes on that don't matter\n2. **Reduce** factors below industry standard\n3. **Raise** factors above industry standard\n4. **Create** factors the industry has never offered\n\n### Four Actions Framework (ERRC Grid)\n\n| Action | Factor | Rationale |\n|--------|--------|-----------|\n| **Eliminate** | Volume bundle wars (2-for deals) | Stop competing in the Prisoner's Dilemma. Don't match Echt/LSKD's multi-buy mechanics. |\n| **Eliminate** | Generic fabric descriptors (\"buttery soft\") | Every competitor says this. It's noise, not signal. |\n| **Reduce** | SKU count / color explosion | LSKD has 30+ colors. Intus should curate fewer, more intentional options. Less choice = stronger identity. |\n| **Reduce** | Discount frequency | Echt's constant sales train customers to wait. Intus should protect price integrity. |\n| **Raise** | Brand narrative depth | \"Within\" philosophy should be visible in every touchpoint — not just an About page. |\n| **Raise** | Return policy (30→60 days) | 92% consumer peace-of-mind at 60-day returns. Immediate trust signal for DTC-only brand. |\n| **Raise** | Supply chain transparency | Flexlara proves this resonates. Mid-range brands haven't claimed this space yet. |\n| **Create** | \"The Kit\" — curated uniform concept | No competitor sells a philosophical daily uniform. Transform bundle from discount to identity. |\n| **Create** | Movement philosophy content | Educational/inspirational content about intentional movement, not just product showcases. |\n\n### Blue Ocean Assessment: VIABLE\n\nThe whitespace exists in \"Intentional Movement\" territory — philosophical depth + mid-range pricing + everyday versatility. No competitor currently occupies this space. The \"Within\" brand name is perfectly positioned to claim it.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Signaling Strategy\n\n### Current Signals (What Intus Communicates Now)\n\n| Signal | Message Received | Problem |\n|--------|-----------------|---------|\n| \"Buttery, soft comfort\" | \"We're like every other brand\" | Generic, zero differentiation |\n| Bundle pricing ($100 sets) | \"We're discounting to compete\" | Perceived as promotional, not premium |\n| DTC-only | \"We're not established enough for retail\" | Trust deficit |\n| #itsallyou | \"Something about community?\" | Underdeveloped, not costly enough to signal quality |\n| Eco Friendly filter | \"We probably care about sustainability\" | Vague, unverified |\n\n### Required Signals (Costly, Credible)\n\nFor signals to be credible, they must be **costly enough that low-quality brands can't fake them**:\n\n| Signal | Cost | Message | Why Competitors Can't Copy Cheaply |\n|--------|------|---------|-------------------------------------|\n| **60-day returns (including worn items)** | Absorb return costs | \"We're so confident in quality, we'll take it back after you've worn it\" | Low-quality brands would face devastating return rates |\n| **Supply chain transparency (mill certificates)** | Audit costs, vulnerability of disclosure | \"We have nothing to hide\" | Brands with opaque supply chains can't provide this without restructuring |\n| **Named fabric technology (once developed)** | R&D + testing investment | \"We invested in performance you can measure\" | Requires actual textile R&D, not just marketing language |\n| **Physical pop-up in athleisure precinct** | Lease + staff costs | \"We're real, you can touch us\" | Establishes permanence signal at fraction of full retail cost |\n| **\"The Kit\" concept** | Curated design effort, limits SKU optionality | \"We have a point of view on how you should dress\" | Requires genuine design philosophy, not just bundling |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Coalition & Partnership Analysis\n\n### Shapley Value Assessment — Where Can Intus Add Value?\n\n| Potential Coalition | Intus's Marginal Contribution | Partner's Marginal Contribution | Coalition Value |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Reformer Pilates studios** | Brand content, kit for members | Physical touchpoint, trusted audience, trust signal | HIGH — closes trust gap + targets core Hybrid Athlete |\n| **Melbourne run clubs** | Apparel for club uniforms/kits | Community access, local credibility, event platform | HIGH — \"The Kit\" concept in action |\n| **Sustainable fabric supplier** | Distribution + brand storytelling | Proprietary fabric tech, sustainability credentials | MEDIUM-HIGH — closes tech gap |\n| **Fitness app (e.g., Strava/Sweat)** | Physical product integration | Digital community, usage data | MEDIUM — scale play but less alignment |\n| **Complementary DTC brand (e.g., supplements, wellness)** | Cross-audience exposure | Same — mutual benefit | MEDIUM — depends on brand alignment |\n\n### Priority Coalition: Reformer Pilates Studios\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Pilates is #2 fitness trend nationally (AUSactive 2025-26)\n- Aligns perfectly with \"Hybrid Athlete\" who does reformer AND coffee runs\n- Physical studio = instant physical touchpoint (closes trust gap without opening a store)\n- Studio can sell \"The Intus Kit\" as recommended member gear\n- Creates a **signaling coalition** — studio endorsement is a costly signal of quality\n\n---\n\n## 8. The STAX Gap — US Market Exploitation\n\n**Critical finding:** STAX explicitly does not ship to the United States.\n\nIntus already offers free shipping to the US (orders >$200 USD). This creates a strategic asymmetry:\n\n| Factor | STAX | Intus |\n|--------|------|-------|\n| US shipping | Blocked | Active (free >$200 USD) |\n| Target demo overlap | High (fashion-forward activewear, 18-35) | High |\n| Price positioning | Premium | Accessible mid-range |\n| Aesthetic | Fashion-forward, inclusive | Minimal, elevated essentials |\n\n**Recommendation:** Target US-based consumers who follow Australian activewear trends but can't access STAX. Position as \"The Australian aesthetic that actually ships to you.\" This is a second-mover advantage in a gap the competitor voluntarily created.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Game-Theoretic Predictions\n\n### The Prediction: What Happens If Intus Does Nothing?\n\nIf Intus enters the market without changing the game:\n1. Gets absorbed into the bundle wars Prisoner's Dilemma\n2. Competes on price/aesthetic against better-funded rivals\n3. Generic vocabulary makes it invisible next to branded-fabric competitors\n4. DTC-only trust gap prevents scaling beyond Melbourne fitness niche\n5. \"Within\" brand meaning remains dormant\n6. **Outcome: Slow attrition, <$500K revenue ceiling, no defensible position**\n\n### The Prescription: Optimal Move Given Competitor Responses\n\n1. **Reframe bundles as \"The Kit\"** — changes from price competition to identity competition\n2. **Extend returns to 60 days** — costly signal that builds trust immediately\n3. **Partner with Pilates studios** — physical touchpoint without physical retail commitment\n4. **Target STAX's US gap** — exploit confirmed competitor weakness\n5. **Develop proprietary fabric** (medium-term) — close the tech moat gap\n\n### The Pivot: How to Reshape the Game\n\nThe fundamental move is to **exit the Red Ocean activewear game and enter the \"Intentional Movement\" game:**\n\n| Red Ocean (Current) | Blue Ocean (Target) |\n|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Competing on fabric feel | Competing on movement philosophy |\n| Bundle discounts | Curated \"Kit\" identity |\n| Generic DTC brand | Studio-partnered lifestyle brand |\n| \"Buttery soft\" | \"The Power Within\" |\n| Price-tier navigation | Philosophy-first navigation |\n\nThis is a Category Design problem, not a JTBD problem. **Recommendation to Strategy & Psychology: pursue Category Design path.**\n\n---\n\n## 10. Integration Outputs → Downstream Departments\n\n| To | Output Delivered |\n|----|-----------------|\n| **Strategy & Psychology** | Category Design recommended (not JTBD). Blue Ocean whitespace = \"Intentional Movement.\" Bundle-as-identity (\"The Kit\") is the micro-innovation. |\n| **Narrative & Verbal** | Current signals are generic. Need costly signal vocabulary. \"Within\" is the narrative foundation. Eliminate all category clichés. |\n| **Creative & Visual** | Visual identity must signal \"philosophical depth + everyday\" — not just \"clean minimal.\" Semiotic dictionary should encode \"Intentional Movement\" meaning. |\n| **Digital & Systems** | Trust gap is the #1 conversion barrier. 60-day returns, sizing tools, review ecosystem are non-negotiable. |\n| **Distribution & Growth** | Pilates studio coalition is the priority partnership. Pop-up in athleisure precinct as phase 2. US targeting against STAX gap. |\n\n---\n\n*Deliverable 2 of 16 — Intus Launch Kit*\n*Next: Gate 1 — Intelligence Review*\n"

This is a losing position.\n\n| Dimension | Intus (Current) | Competitor Default | Verdict |\n|-----------|----------------|-------------------|---------|\n| Fabric | \"Buttery, soft comfort\" | \"DreamKnit\", \"Airlyte\", \"Peach Perfect\" | **Same frame** — Intus uses generic descriptors while competitors own proprietary names |\n| Pricing | Bundle & Save ($100 sets) | 2-for deals, volume bundles, constant sales | **Same frame** — both use discount mechanics to drive AOV |\n| Aesthetic | \"Clean, elevated essentials\" | \"Minimal\", \"premium\", \"elevated\" | **Same frame** — every mid-range brand claims this |\n| Community | #itsallyou | \"1% Better Every Day\" (LSKD), \"Active Living\" (Lorna Jane) | **Same frame** — hashtag without costly signal |\n| Sustainability | \"Eco Friendly\" filter on site | Recycled polyester, B Corp, carbon neutral | **Same frame** — sustainability as footnote, not headline |\n\n### Required Shift: From \"Better\" to \"Different\"\n\nThe Phase 1 competitive analysis confirmed: Intus cannot out-spend, out-distribute, or out-tech its competitors. The only viable path is to **reframe what the competition is about**.\n\n**The reframe:** Stop competing on *what activewear is made of* and start competing on *what movement means*.\n\n| \"Better\" (Current Frame) | \"Different\" (New Frame) |\n|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| \"Our fabric is softer\" | \"We believe movement has meaning\" |\n| \"Our bundles save you money\" | \"The Kit is your daily uniform for intentional living\" |\n| \"We're like Gymshark but cleaner\" | \"We're the brand for people who move with purpose\" |\n| \"Activewear for the gym\" | \"Essentials for the Hybrid Athlete's entire day\" |\n\n**Verdict: DIFFERENT path confirmed. Category Design is the strategic fork.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Strategic Fork: Category Design\n\n### Why Category Design (Not JTBD)\n\n| Criteria | Category Design | JTBD | Intus Fit |\n|----------|----------------|------|-----------|\n| Market state | Create new space | Serve existing needs better | Intus needs new space — \"better activewear\" is a Red Ocean |\n| Customer language | Doesn't exist yet | Customers can articulate it | Customers don't have words for \"intentional movement\" yet |\n| Competitive response | Hard to follow (category queen advantage) | Easy to copy (feature parity) | Intus needs a position competitors can't copy |\n| Brand name alignment | \"Intus\" = Latin for \"within\" = perfect category vessel | Name is irrelevant to job | The name IS the category |\n| Revenue ceiling | Category queens capture 76% of category economics | Incremental share gains | Intus needs disproportionate capture, not incremental share |\n\n**Decision: Category Design. Intus will design and own the \"Intentional Movement\" category.**\n\n### The Category: Intentional Movement\n\n**Category Definition:** Intentional Movement is the practice of moving through your entire day — gym, studio, commute, social — with awareness and purpose. It rejects the binary of \"workout clothes\" vs. \"real clothes\" and the hustle-culture framing of \"no days off.\" Intentional Movement says: every movement counts, not just the ones that make you sweat.\n\n**Category Name Candidates:**\n\n| Option | Strengths | Weaknesses | Recommendation |\n|--------|-----------|------------|----------------|\n| \"Intentional Movement\" | Descriptive, philosophical depth, aligns with \"Within\" | Slightly long, may need shortening for hashtags | **PRIMARY** |\n| \"Movement Philosophy\" | Academic gravitas, content-rich | Could feel pretentious for mid-range brand | Secondary / content pillar name |\n| \"Everyday Movement\" | Accessible, clear | Generic, lacks philosophical weight | Reject |\n\n**The Word Intus Owns:** \"Intentional\"\n\nEvery category queen owns a word. Volvo owns \"safety.\" Patagonia owns \"environment.\" **Intus owns \"intentional.\"** This word connects:\n- \"Intentional Movement\" (the category)\n- \"Intentional design\" (the product philosophy)\n- \"Intentional living\" (the customer aspiration)\n- \"Intus\" / \"Within\" (the brand origin — intention starts within)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Category Blueprint\n\n### The Ecosystem Map\n\n```\n                    INTENTIONAL MOVEMENT\n                           |\n            +--------------+--------------+\n            |              |              |\n        THE PRACTICE   THE PRODUCT    THE COMMUNITY\n            |              |              |\n    +-------+-------+  +--+--+    +------+------+\n    |       |       |  |     |    |      |      |\n  Studio  Street  Rest Kit  Layers  Studios  Clubs  Digital\n  Movement Movement     Singles       Partners  Content\n```\n\n**THE PRACTICE** — What Intentional Movement looks like:\n- **Studio Movement:** Reformer Pilates, yoga, functional training (high-awareness exercise)\n- **Street Movement:** Walking, running, cycling to/from places (movement as transport, not just exercise)\n- **Rest as Movement:** Recovery, stretching, mindful stillness (intentional non-movement)\n\n**THE PRODUCT** — What Intus makes for Intentional Movers:\n- **The Kit:** Curated daily uniform (top + bottom as identity set, not discount bundle)\n- **Layers:** Outerwear and transition pieces for between-movement states\n- **Singles:** Individual pieces that integrate into The Kit ecosystem\n\n**THE COMMUNITY** — Where Intentional Movers gather:\n- **Studio Partners:** Reformer Pilates studios (priority coalition from Phase 1B)\n- **Movement Clubs:** Melbourne run clubs, walking groups, outdoor fitness\n- **Digital Content:** Movement philosophy content (education, not product showcases)\n\n### Category Potential (CP)\n\n**CP = People with the problem x Price willing to pay**\n\n- Addressable population: The \"Hybrid Athlete\" segment in Australia = ~2.4M consumers (18-35, metro, fitness-active, dual gender)\n- Problem prevalence: ~60% feel their activewear doesn't represent their full lifestyle (gym-only framing)\n- Price willingness: Mid-range sweet spot ($45-$115 AUD per item, $100-$200 per Kit)\n- **CP = 1.44M x $150 avg Kit = ~$216M addressable category value**\n\nThis aligns with the Phase 1A serviceable market estimate of $200-250M.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Positioning Architecture\n\n### The Positioning Statement\n\n**For** the Hybrid Athlete who moves between studio, street, and social life,\n**Intus** is the **Intentional Movement brand** that\n**provides** curated daily uniforms (\"The Kit\") designed for how you actually live,\n**unlike** traditional activewear brands that optimize for the gym and treat everything else as an afterthought,\n**because** Intus believes every movement has meaning — and what you wear should reflect that intention.\n\n### The POV (Point of View)\n\nEvery activewear brand asks: \"What do you do when you work out?\"\n\nIntus asks: **\"What do you do between workouts?\"**\n\nThat question changes everything. Because the Hybrid Athlete doesn't segment their day into \"gym time\" and \"real life.\" They move through reformer class, coffee with friends, a walking meeting, grocery shopping, and evening stretching — all as one continuous flow. Their clothes should work the same way.\n\nTraditional activewear is designed for the 60-minute window. Intus is designed for the other 23 hours.\n\n### Problem → Solution → Outcome\n\n| Layer | Traditional Frame | Intus Frame |\n|-------|------------------|-------------|\n| **Problem** | \"I need clothes for the gym\" | \"I need clothes that move with me all day\" |\n| **Solution** | Performance fabrics, gym-optimized fit | Curated Kits for the full-day Hybrid Athlete |\n| **Outcome** | \"I look good at the gym\" | \"I move through my day with intention and confidence\" |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Behavioral Economics Execution Layer\n\n### 5.1 Anchoring Strategy\n\n**The Kit as Anchor:** Launch \"The Kit\" at $100 AUD. This becomes the reference price for the Intus ecosystem.\n- Individual pieces (Tank $45, Shorts $55 = $100 separately) are priced to make The Kit feel like the natural choice\n- This is NOT a discount. The Kit IS the product. Individual pieces are the unbundled version.\n\n**Reframe:** \"The Kit for $100\" (identity framing) vs. \"Tank + Shorts for $100\" (discount framing). Same price, different psychology.\n\n### 5.2 Loss Aversion Deployment\n\n**60-Day Return Policy** (recommended in Phase 1B as costly signal):\n- Frame: \"Try The Kit for 60 days. If it doesn't change how you move, send it back.\"\n- Psychology: Once customers have worn The Kit for 60 days, loss aversion kicks in — returning it means *losing* their daily uniform\n- Competitors with 30-day policies can't match this without absorbing higher return costs\n- Expected return rate: <8% (Flexlara's 64% 90-day reorder rate suggests high satisfaction in this category)\n\n### 5.3 Sunk Cost & Identity Lock-In\n\n**\"The Kit\" Collection Strategy:**\n- Season 1: Launch with 3 Kit combinations (Reformer Kit, Street Kit, Recovery Kit)\n- Season 2: Introduce Kit extensions (add a Layer piece to existing Kit)\n- Season 3: Kit evolution (updated colorways that complement previous Kits)\n- Psychology: Each Kit purchase increases identity investment. Customers who own 2+ Kits are buying into the Intentional Movement lifestyle, not just clothes.\n\n### 5.4 Social Proof Architecture\n\n| Signal Type | Mechanism | Deployment |\n|-------------|-----------|------------|\n| **Community Volume** | \"X Kits claimed this week\" (real-time counter) | Product pages, checkout |\n| **Authority** | Pilates studio partnerships (instructor endorsement) | Studio presence, Instagram co-content |\n| **Conformity** | \"What's in my Kit\" UGC content format | TikTok/Instagram format, #MyIntusKit |\n| **Scarcity** | Seasonal Kit colorways (limited, not artificial) | Quarterly drops, genuine limited runs |\n\n### 5.5 Mental Accounting\n\nPosition The Kit in the \"daily essentials\" mental account, not the \"activewear splurge\" account:\n- \"$100 for your daily uniform\" (like coffee: $5/day x 20 days = $100/month)\n- Comparison anchors: \"Less than a month of daily coffee\" or \"Less than one Lorna Jane legging\"\n- BNPL reinforcement: $25/fortnight via Afterpay = \"the cost of two coffees a week\"\n\n---\n\n## 6. FROTOS — Target Belief Mapping\n\n### Audience 1: The Hybrid Athlete (Female, 22-30, AU Metro)\n\n| FROTOS Dimension | Target |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| **Frequency** | 3-5 brand touches per week (Instagram, TikTok, email) |\n| **Reach** | 150K-200K in first 90 days (Melbourne/Sydney primary, Brisbane secondary) |\n| **Overlap** | Minimum 2 channels per prospect (social + email or social + studio) |\n| **Thinking** | **Before:** \"Activewear is for the gym.\" **After:** \"Intus gets how I actually live — gym, studio, street, all of it.\" |\n| **Overall** | **Before:** \"Never heard of Intus.\" **After:** \"Intus is the Intentional Movement brand — it's different from LSKD/Echt.\" |\n| **Selling** | **Before:** Zero awareness. **After:** Kit trial (first purchase via 60-day guarantee) within 90 days of first touch. |\n\n**Target Belief to Shift:** \"My activewear should work for my whole day, not just my workout.\"\n\n### Audience 2: The Conscious Male (25-35, AU Metro)\n\n| FROTOS Dimension | Target |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| **Frequency** | 2-3 brand touches per week |\n| **Reach** | 50K-75K in first 90 days |\n| **Overlap** | Minimum 2 channels (YouTube + Instagram or social + studio) |\n| **Thinking** | **Before:** \"Men's activewear is either gym-bro (Gymshark) or too expensive (Vuori).\" **After:** \"Intus is the elevated essential that fits my life — clean, no logos, just quality.\" |\n| **Overall** | **Before:** \"Men's activewear options are polarized.\" **After:** \"Intus fills the gap I didn't know existed.\" |\n| **Selling** | **Before:** Zero awareness. **After:** Single piece trial → Kit conversion within 120 days. |\n\n**Target Belief to Shift:** \"There's a brand between gym-bro and premium that's made for how I actually dress.\"\n\n### Audience 3: The AU-Aesthetic Seeker (Female, 20-28, US-Based)\n\n| FROTOS Dimension | Target |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| **Frequency** | 2-3 brand touches per week |\n| **Reach** | 30K-50K in first 90 days (US targeted) |\n| **Overlap** | Minimum 2 channels (TikTok + Instagram) |\n| **Thinking** | **Before:** \"I love Australian activewear but STAX doesn't ship to the US.\" **After:** \"Intus is the AU brand that actually ships to me — and it has a philosophy I connect with.\" |\n| **Overall** | **Before:** \"Australian activewear is inaccessible.\" **After:** \"Intus IS accessible Australian activewear with intention.\" |\n| **Selling** | **Before:** Zero awareness. **After:** Kit purchase (free US shipping >$200 USD) within 90 days. |\n\n**Target Belief to Shift:** \"The Australian aesthetic I want is available and affordable to ship.\"\n\n---\n\n## 7. Lightning Strike Plan\n\n### Strike Architecture: Concentrated 2-Week Launch Window\n\n**Principle:** Intentional Movement is a new category. New categories require Lightning Strikes — concentrated awareness pushes that create the sense of inevitability. Drip marketing cannot build a category.\n\n### Pre-Strike (Weeks -4 to -1): Ground Preparation\n\n| Action | Owner | Timeline |\n|--------|-------|----------|\n| Finalize 3 Kit combinations (Reformer, Street, Recovery) | Product/Creative | Week -4 |\n| Secure 3-5 Melbourne Pilates studio partnerships | Distribution | Week -4 to -2 |\n| Produce \"The Within Story\" founder content (origin of Intus name) | Narrative/Creative | Week -3 |\n| Build \"What's In My Kit\" UGC template for seeding | Creative/Distribution | Week -2 |\n| Seed 10-15 Pilates instructors with Kits (no posting obligation — costly signal) | Distribution | Week -2 |\n| Email list warm-up: \"Something is changing\" teaser sequence | Distribution | Week -1 |\n| 60-day return policy implemented and QA'd on site | Digital | Week -1 |\n\n### Air Wars (Week 1-2): Category Announcement\n\n| Channel | Content | Frequency |\n|---------|---------|-----------|\n| **TikTok** | \"The 23-Hour Question\" — POV content asking what you wear between workouts | 5-7 posts/week |\n| **Instagram** | \"The Kit\" visual reveals — styled as daily uniform, not gym outfit | 4-5 posts/week + Stories daily |\n| **YouTube** | \"The Within Story\" — 3-5 min founder documentary on why movement has meaning | 1 anchor video + 3 shorts |\n| **Email** | \"Introducing Intentional Movement\" — category manifesto + Kit reveal | 3 emails over 2 weeks |\n| **PR** | Pitch to AU fitness/lifestyle media: \"Melbourne brand redefines what activewear is for\" | 5-10 targeted pitches |\n\n### Ground Wars (Week 1-2): Physical Activation\n\n| Activation | Location | Mechanic |\n|------------|----------|----------|\n| \"The Kit Launch\" at partner Pilates studios | 3-5 Melbourne studios | Kit display + QR code for exclusive studio discount. Instructors wear Kits during class. |\n| Melbourne run club activation | 1-2 running groups | \"The Street Kit\" worn by 10 runners. Post-run coffee. Photographer captures the transition (run → cafe). |\n| Pop-up \"Kit Bar\" (if budget allows) | Melbourne athleisure precinct | 48-hour popup where customers build their own Kit from curated options. Not a store — an experience. |\n\n### Post-Strike (Weeks 3-4): Sustain & Convert\n\n- Retarget all Strike engagement with Kit offers (60-day guarantee prominent)\n- Activate UGC: \"What's in your Kit?\" campaign using seeded content from instructors\n- Email nurture: \"The Intentional Movement Guide\" — educational content, not sales\n- Studio partners begin selling Kits as \"recommended member gear\"\n\n### Strike Success Metrics\n\n| Metric | Target | Measurement |\n|--------|--------|-------------|\n| Kit sales (first 30 days) | 200+ Kits | Shopify |\n| Email list growth | +2,000 subscribers | Klaviyo |\n| Social reach (paid + organic) | 500K+ impressions | Platform analytics |\n| Studio partnership conversions | 50+ Kit sales via studio QR | UTM tracking |\n| \"Intentional Movement\" search volume | Baseline → measurable increase | Google Trends |\n| UGC posts (#MyIntusKit) | 50+ within 30 days | Social listening |\n\n---\n\n## 8.

      "content": "# Brand Archetype Guide — Intus\n**Department:** Strategy & Psychology Lab\n**Phase:** 2B | Launch Kit\n**Date:** February 2026\n\n---\n\n## 1. Archetype Selection Process\n\n### Psychographic Analysis of Target Customer\n\nThe Hybrid Athlete is defined by these psychological traits:\n\n| Trait | Expression | Archetype Resonance |\n|-------|-----------|-------------------|\n| **Seeks meaning in daily action** | Chooses reformer Pilates over random gym sessions. Walks instead of drives when possible. | Magician (transformation of ordinary → meaningful) |\n| **Rejects hustle culture** | Wants to move with intention, not punish their body. \"Grounded alternative to hustle culture.\" | Sage (wisdom, thoughtfulness over aggression) |\n| **Values authenticity over logos** | Prefers minimal style with precise cuts. Dislikes loud branding. | Creator (self-expression through restraint) |\n| **Identity-driven purchasing** | Buys into lifestyle, not just product. Community-seeking (#itsallyou). | Magician (identity transformation) |\n| **Bridges multiple worlds** | Gym → studio → coffee → work. Doesn't segment life into compartments. | Magician (dissolves boundaries, creates unity) |\n\n### Archetype Scoring Matrix\n\n| Archetype | Brand Name Fit | Target Psyche Fit | Category Fit | Competitive Differentiation | Total |\n|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------------|-------|\n| **Magician** | 5/5 (\"Within\" = inner transformation) | 5/5 (meaning-seeking, identity-driven) | 5/5 (Category Design = creating new reality) | 5/5 (no competitor uses this archetype) | **20/20** |\n| **Sage** | 4/5 (\"Intentional\" = wisdom) | 4/5 (thoughtful, anti-hustle) | 4/5 (philosophy-driven brand) | 4/5 (Vuori is closest but positions as Explorer) | **16/20** |\n| **Explorer** | 3/5 (inner journey, some alignment) | 3/5 (freedom-seeking but not primary driver) | 3/5 (exploration ≠ category creation) | 2/5 (Vuori owns this, Lorna Jane claims \"Active Living\") | **11/20** |\n| **Hero** | 2/5 (\"Champion\" value, but forced) | 2/5 (hustle-adjacent, could backfire) | 2/5 (Hero = \"better\", not \"different\") | 1/5 (Gymshark, LSKD, Nike all play Hero) | **7/20** |\n| **Creator** | 3/5 (self-expression angle) | 3/5 (aesthetic-driven segment) | 2/5 (Creator builds artifacts, not categories) | 2/5 (fashion-forward brands claim this) | **10/20** |\n\n### Selection: Magician (Primary) + Sage (Secondary)\n\n**Quadrant Clash Check:**\n- Magician = Risk/Mastery quadrant\n- Sage = Independence/Fulfillment quadrant\n- **No clash.** Adjacent quadrants. Magician provides the transformative energy; Sage provides the philosophical grounding. Together they create: *a brand that transforms your relationship with movement through wisdom, not force.*\n\n---\n\n## 2. Primary Archetype: The Magician\n\n### Archetype Profile\n\n| Dimension | The Magician |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Core Desire** | To understand the fundamental laws of the universe and make dreams reality |\n| **Goal** | Transform reality, create something magical from the ordinary |\n| **Fear** | Unintended negative consequences |\n| **Strategy** | Develop a vision and live it |\n| **Gift** | Finding win-win solutions, catalyzing change |\n| **Shadow** | Manipulation, disconnection from reality |\n| **Voice** | Visionary, assured, transformative |\n| **Brand Promise** | \"I can make it happen — I can transform your experience\" |\n\n### Why Magician for Intus\n\n1. **The Name IS the Archetype.** \"Intus\" means \"within\" — the Magician's power source is always internal. The brand name literally describes where transformation originates.\n\n2. **The Category IS Transformation.** \"Intentional Movement\" transforms the mundane act of getting dressed into a philosophical practice. It transforms a gym visit into a meaningful ritual. It transforms a bundle discount into a daily uniform. This is Magician territory.\n\n3. **\"The Kit\" IS Alchemy.** The Kit takes two ordinary pieces of clothing (tank + shorts) and transforms them into something greater than the sum of their parts — a curated identity. This is the Magician's signature move: turning base materials into gold.\n\n4. **No Competitor Occupies This Space.**\n   - Gymshark = Hero (\"Be a visionary\")\n   - LSKD = Hero (\"1% Better Every Day\")\n   - Lorna Jane = Caregiver/Ruler (\"Active Living\" as prescription)\n   - Vuori = Explorer (\"Investment in Happiness\" / coastal freedom)\n   - Echt = Everyman (accessible, variety, frequent sales)\n   - STAX = Lover (fashion-forward, body-positive, sensory)\n   - **Magician is completely unoccupied in Australian activewear.**\n\n5. **Magician Survives the Tremble Test.** If competitors shift positioning, the Magician archetype holds because it's anchored in the brand's etymology (Intus = within = transformation from inside). A competitor would need to change their name and entire philosophy to copy this.\n\n### Magician Expression Across Touchpoints\n\n| Touchpoint | Magician Expression | What It's NOT |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Product naming** | Evocative, elemental (Zyra, Eclipse, Unity) — suggests transformation states | Not technical specs (FlexWeave 3.0) or performance jargon |\n| **Photography** | Captures the *moment of transition* — leaving the studio, arriving at the cafe, the in-between | Not gym action shots or posed fitness photography |\n| **Copy** | \"The power within\" / \"Transform how you move\" / \"Intention starts inside\" | Not \"crush your workout\" or \"outperform the competition\" |\n| **Social content** | POV: \"Watch how this changes\" — showing transformations in perspective, not body | Not before/after body transformations or workout tutorials |\n| **Retail/studio presence** | Feels like entering a different state — curated, intentional, calm | Not high-energy, loud music, aggressive merchandising |\n| **Packaging** | Unboxing is a ritual — thoughtful, layered, reveals The Kit as a unified identity | Not just product in a mailer bag |\n| **Email** | Subject lines that promise transformation: \"You're about to see movement differently\" | Not \"SALE: 30% off everything\" or \"New arrivals just dropped\" |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Secondary Archetype: The Sage\n\n### Archetype Profile\n\n| Dimension | The Sage |\n|-----------|---------|\n| **Core Desire** | To find the truth, understand the world |\n| **Goal** | Use intelligence and analysis to understand the world |\n| **Fear** | Being duped, ignorance, being misled |\n| **Strategy** | Seek out information and knowledge |\n| **Gift** | Wisdom, intelligence, expertise |\n| **Shadow** | Ivory tower disconnection, overthinking |\n| **Voice** | Thoughtful, authoritative, considered |\n| **Brand Promise** | \"I can help you think about this differently\" |\n\n### Why Sage as Secondary\n\n1. **\"Intentional\" IS a Sage Word.** The category name itself (\"Intentional Movement\") carries Sage energy — it asks customers to *think* about movement, not just do it.\n\n2. **Content Strategy Demands It.** Phase 1B identified \"Movement philosophy content\" as a Blue Ocean factor to *create*. This is pure Sage territory — educational, perspective-shifting content that no competitor produces.\n\n3. **Counterbalances the Magician's Shadow.** The Magician's risk is perceived manipulation or empty mysticism. The Sage grounds the transformation in real philosophy, real wisdom, real substance. Together: *magical but not mystical, transformative but not superficial.*\n\n4. **Anti-Hustle Positioning.** The Sage rejects the \"no days off\" Hero mentality that dominates activewear. It says: \"Move with thought, not force.\" This directly appeals to the Hybrid Athlete's rejection of hustle culture.\n\n### Sage Expression Across Touchpoints\n\n| Touchpoint | Sage Expression |\n|------------|----------------|\n| **Content** | \"The Intentional Movement Guide\" — educational content about why movement matters, not just how to exercise |\n| **Product descriptions** | Explains the *intention* behind each design choice, not just features |\n| **Social** | Thought-provoking questions: \"When was the last time you moved without a goal?\" |\n| **Email** | Knowledge-sharing: movement philosophy, mindfulness in motion, the science of intentional practice |\n| **Brand voice** | Considered, never rushed. Short sentences with weight. Statements, not exclamations. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Archetype Blend Ratio\n\n### 70% Magician / 30% Sage\n\n| Context | Blend | Rationale |\n|---------|-------|-----------|\n| **Product & Packaging** | 80/20 Magician | The product IS the transformation. Sage provides the \"why\" in product descriptions. |\n| **Social Content** | 70/30 | Magician creates the visual magic (transitions, transformations). Sage provides the thoughtful captions and questions. |\n| **Email & CRM** | 60/40 | More Sage in nurture sequences — build understanding before asking for the sale. |\n| **Website Copy** | 70/30 | Homepage leads with Magician (transformation promise). About page leans Sage (the philosophy). |\n| **Studio Partnerships** | 50/50 | Equal blend — the studio IS the transformative space (Magician), and the partnership IS the credible endorsement (Sage). |\n| **Lightning Strike** | 80/20 Magician | Launch demands energy and transformation. Sage provides the POV depth (\"What do you do between workouts?\"). |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Archetype Consistency Rules\n\n### Always\n\n- **Always** lead with transformation, follow with wisdom\n- **Always** show the in-between moments (Magician dissolves boundaries)\n- **Always** ask questions that shift perspective (Sage provokes thought)\n- **Always** frame The Kit as an identity transformation, not a purchase\n- **Always** use \"intentional\" as the connective word between archetype and category\n- **Always** photograph people in transition states — never static poses\n\n### Never\n\n- **Never** use aggressive/competitive language (Hero territory — belongs to Gymshark/LSKD)\n- **Never** use overtly sensual/body-focused imagery (Lover territory — belongs to STAX)\n- **Never** use \"hustle\", \"grind\", \"no excuses\", \"beast mode\" (Hero shadow)\n- **Never** promise transformation without substance (Magician shadow = manipulation)\n- **Never** lecture or condescend (Sage shadow = ivory tower)\n- **Never** discount The Kit (undermines the Magician's alchemy — you don't discount magic)\n- **Never** use \"buttery soft\", \"squat-proof\", or generic activewear vocabulary (breaks both archetypes)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Competitive Archetype Map\n\n### The Australian Activewear Archetype Landscape\n\n```\n        INDEPENDENCE / FULFILLMENT\n                |\n    Sage        |        Explorer\n    (INTUS 2nd) |        (Vuori)\n                |\nRISK/MASTERY ---+--- BELONGING/ENJOYMENT\n                |\n    Magician    |        Everyman\n    (INTUS 1st) |        (Echt)\n                |\n        STABILITY / CONTROL\n\n    Hero: Gymshark, LSKD, Nike\n    Caregiver/Ruler: Lorna Jane\n    Lover: STAX\n    Outlaw: (unoccupied)\n    Creator: (unoccupied)\n    Jester: (unoccupied)\n```\n\n**Intus occupies the Magician-Sage corridor — entirely uncontested in Australian activewear.**\n\nThe nearest competitor archetype (Vuori as Explorer) is in an adjacent quadrant but a fundamentally different position. Explorer seeks external freedom; Magician seeks internal transformation. No collision.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Archetype-to-Category Alignment Verification\n\n| Category Element | Archetype Alignment | Status |\n|-----------------|--------------------| ------|\n| \"Intentional Movement\" category name | Magician (transformation of meaning) + Sage (intentionality as wisdom) | ALIGNED |\n| \"The Kit\" product concept | Magician (alchemy — two items become one identity) | ALIGNED |\n| \"Within\" brand philosophy | Magician (inner transformation) | ALIGNED |\n| 60-day return policy | Magician (confidence in transformation) + Sage (trust through transparency) | ALIGNED |\n| Pilates studio partnerships | Magician (studio as transformative space) + Sage (instructor as credible authority) | ALIGNED |\n| \"What do you do between workouts?\" POV | Sage (reframing the question) + Magician (dissolving the gym/life boundary) | ALIGNED |\n| Bundle-as-identity pricing | Magician (transforms price mechanic into identity purchase) | ALIGNED |\n| STAX US gap exploitation | Sage (strategic wisdom — exploit confirmed market gap) | ALIGNED |\n\n**All 8 category elements align with the Magician/Sage archetype blend. No contradictions detected.**\n\n---\n\n## 8. Integration Outputs to Downstream Departments\n\n| To | Output |\n|----|--------|\n| **Narrative & Verbal** | Magician/Sage voice dimensions. The word \"intentional\" as brand vocabulary anchor. Transformation language (not competition language). Question-based engagement (Sage). Never use Hero vocabulary. |\n| **Creative & Visual** | Magician visual codes: transition moments, alchemy (two → one), \"in-between\" photography. Sage visual codes: clean space, considered composition, quiet confidence. See Section 2 touchpoint table. |\n| **Digital & Systems** | Magician UX: The Kit builder should feel like a ritual, not a cart. Sage UX: Product pages explain intention behind design. Avoid aggressive conversion tactics (breaks both archetypes). |\n| **Distribution & Growth** | Magician content: transformation POVs, before/after perspective shifts (not body). Sage content: movement philosophy, \"Intentional Movement Guide.\" Lightning Strike = 80/20 Magician/Sage. |\n\n---\n\n*Deliverable 4 of 16 — Intus Launch Kit*\n*Next: Gate 2 — Strategy Review*\n"

Brand Architecture\n\n### Model: Branded House\n\nIntus operates as a single unified brand. All product lines (Zyra, Core, Unity, Agility, Eclipse) live under the Intus master identity. There are no sub-brands or endorsed brands.\n\n| Element | Decision | Rationale |\n|---------|----------|-----------|\n| Architecture | Branded House | Early-stage startup — maximize equity under one name. Every touchpoint builds \"Intus.\" |\n| Product naming | Collection names (Zyra, Eclipse, etc.) | Evocative, elemental names that suggest transformation states — aligned with Magician archetype. |\n| Naming convention | Latin/elemental roots | Consistent with \"Intus\" (Latin for \"within\"). Future collections should follow this convention. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. StoryBrand SB7 Framework — The Intus BrandScript\n\n### 1. A Character (The Hero)\n\n**The Hybrid Athlete.**\n\nYou move between reformer class, coffee with friends, a walking meeting, and evening stretching — all in a single day. You don't separate \"gym time\" from \"real life.\" You're value-conscious but won't compromise on quality. You want clothes that understand how you actually live, not just how you work out.\n\n*Note: The customer is ALWAYS the hero. Intus is NEVER the hero.*\n\n### 2. Has a Problem\n\n**External Problem (tangible):**\nYour activewear is designed for one hour at the gym. The rest of your day, you're changing, layering, or settling for clothes that don't feel right.\n\n**Internal Problem (emotional):**\nYou feel like no brand actually gets you. The gym brands feel too aggressive. The fashion brands feel too expensive. The budget brands feel disposable. You're stuck in between — and that in-between is where you actually live.\n\n**Philosophical Problem (moral):**\nIt shouldn't be this hard. Movement is natural. Dressing for your day should be natural too. Why does the industry make you choose between gym clothes and real clothes?\n\n**The Villain:**\nThe false divide between \"workout\" and \"life\" — the idea that you need separate wardrobes for separate selves.\n\n### 3. Meets a Guide (Intus)\n\n**Empathy Statement:**\nWe know what it's like to move through a whole day — studio to street to social — and want to feel right the entire time. Not just for the workout. For everything in between.\n\n**Authority Signals:**\n- Designed in Melbourne for the Hybrid Athlete's full day\n- Curated Kits (not random bundles) built around how you actually move\n- 60-day guarantee — wear it, live in it, and if it doesn't transform how you dress, return it\n- Endorsed by Pilates studios (partner instructors wear The Kit in class)\n\n### 4. Who Gives Them a Plan\n\n**Process Plan (3 Steps):**\n\n| Step | Action | Psychological Trigger |\n|------|--------|-----------------------|\n| 1 | **Choose Your Kit** | Identity selection (not product selection). \"Which Kit matches your day?\" |\n| 2 | **Wear It Everywhere** | Permission to break the gym/life divide. 60-day guarantee removes risk. |\n| 3 | **Move With Intention** | Transformation complete. You're not wearing activewear — you're dressed for intentional movement. |\n\n**Agreement Plan (Guarantees):**\n- 60-day wear-and-return guarantee (including worn items)\n- Free shipping on orders over $150 AUD / $200 USD\n- Afterpay/Klarna available ($25/fortnight)\n\n### 5. Calls Them to Action\n\n**Direct CTA:** \"Get Your Kit\"\n\n**Transitional CTAs:**\n- \"Take the Kit Quiz\" (which Kit matches your day?)\n- \"Read the Movement Guide\" (educational content — Sage expression)\n- \"See What's In My Kit\" (UGC gallery — social proof)\n\n*Never use: \"Shop Now\", \"Buy Now\", \"Submit\", \"Learn More\"*\n\n### 6. Helps Them Avoid Failure\n\n**What happens if you do nothing:**\n- You keep buying gym clothes that only work at the gym\n- You keep changing 2-3 times a day\n- You keep feeling like no brand understands your actual lifestyle\n- You keep settling for \"good enough\" instead of intentional\n\n**The stakes (loss aversion framing):**\n\"Every day you dress without intention is a day you move through life on autopilot.\"\n\n### 7. Ends in Success\n\n**External Success:** One Kit. Your whole day. No more changing, no more compromising, no more outfit anxiety.\n\n**Internal Success:** You feel understood. A brand finally gets that your life doesn't happen in segments. You move with purpose, dressed with intention, confident from studio to street.\n\n**Philosophical Success:** Movement has meaning again. Not as punishment. Not as performance. As an expression of who you are — from within.\n\n**Status Transformation:** From \"someone who wears gym clothes\" → \"someone who dresses for intentional movement.\"\n\n---\n\n## 3. The One-Liner\n\n**Problem:** Most activewear is designed for the gym — but your life doesn't happen in a gym.\n\n**Solution:** Intus creates curated Kits for the Hybrid Athlete's entire day.\n\n**Result:** Move through your whole day with intention, dressed in one Kit that works everywhere.\n\n**Full One-Liner:**\n*\"Most activewear is designed for one hour at the gym. Intus creates Kits for the other 23. Move with intention — from studio, to street, to everywhere in between.\"*\n\n---\n\n## 4. Brand Manifesto\n\n### Framework: The Declaration + The Vignette (Hybrid)\n\n---\n\n**WITHIN**\n\nYou don't have a gym self and a real self.\nYou have one body. One day. One way of moving through it.\n\nThe alarm goes off. You reach for The Kit — not because it's workout gear, not because it's casual wear, but because it's yours. Designed for how you actually live.\n\nReformer at 6:30.\nCoffee at 8.\nA meeting that could've been an email at 10.\nA walk because you needed to think at noon.\nGroceries. A friend.

Voice Dimensions\n\n### The Intus Voice: Magician (70%) + Sage (30%)\n\nThe Intus voice sounds like a thoughtful friend who sees things differently — someone who makes you pause and rethink what you thought you knew, without ever lecturing you. Assured but never arrogant. Quiet but never passive. Transformative but always grounded.\n\n| Dimension | Expression | What It Sounds Like | What It NEVER Sounds Like |\n|-----------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Personality** | Intentional, assured, warm, perceptive | A reformer instructor who also reads philosophy | A personal trainer yelling at you / A fashion brand being aloof |\n| **Style** | Short sentences with weight. Statements over exclamations. Questions that reframe. | \"You don't need more clothes. You need the right Kit.\" | \"OMG you NEED this!! Shop now!! Limited time!!\" |\n| **Vocabulary** | Intentional, movement, within, Kit, curated, transition, flow, purpose | Words that suggest awareness and transformation | \"Crush it\", \"beast mode\", \"hustle\", \"slay\", \"buttery soft\" |\n| **Energy** | Calm confidence. 6/10 on the intensity scale. Rises to 7/10 for launches, drops to 5/10 for nurture. | Steady, rhythmic, like a walking pace | Never breathless, never urgent, never aggressive |\n\n### Tone Map (Context-Specific Adjustments)\n\n| Situation | Tone Adjustment | Example |\n|-----------|----------------|---------|\n| **Product launch** | Energy rises to 7/10. More Magician. | \"Something is about to change how you dress. The Reformer Kit is here.\" |\n| **Educational content** | Sage forward (60/40). Reflective, questioning. | \"When was the last time you moved without a destination?\" |\n| **Customer service** | Warm, direct, solution-oriented. No blame. | \"That doesn't sound right. Let's sort this out — reply here or DM us.\" |\n| **Social captions** | Conversational, observation-based. Short. | \"Studio → flat white → everywhere else. One Kit.\" |\n| **Email nurture** | Sage forward. Building understanding. | \"You're about to see your wardrobe differently. Here's why.\" |\n| **Sale/promotion** | DOES NOT EXIST. Intus does not run sales. Price integrity is a core signal. | N/A — see \"Forbidden Contexts\" below |\n| **Error/issue** | Human, accountable, immediate solution. | \"We got that wrong. Here's what we're doing about it.\" |\n\n### Forbidden Contexts\n\nThe Intus voice is NEVER used for:\n- Discount/sale language (The Kit is never discounted)\n- Urgency-based promotion (\"Hurry!\", \"Last chance!\", countdown timers)\n- Competitive comparison (\"Better than Brand X\")\n- Body-focused messaging (\"Get your dream body\", \"Look amazing\")\n- Hustle culture language (\"No excuses\", \"Rise and grind\")\n\n---\n\n## 2. Word Bank\n\n### Power Words (Use Frequently)\n\n| Category | Words |\n|----------|-------|\n| **Movement** | intentional, flow, transition, movement, purpose, rhythm, practice |\n| **Identity** | within, Kit, curated, yours, chosen, daily, ritual |\n| **Transformation** | shift, change, transform, reframe, dissolve, become, emerge |\n| **Quality** | considered, crafted, designed, built, precise, refined |\n| **Feeling** | confident, grounded, right, natural, seamless, effortless |\n| **Community** | circle, together, collective, shared, studio, club |\n\n### Community Words (Brand-Specific Vocabulary)\n\n| Term | Definition | Usage |\n|------|-----------|-------|\n| **The Kit** | A curated top + bottom combination designed as a daily uniform. Always capitalized. | \"Get Your Kit\" / \"What's in your Kit?\" |\n| **Intentional Movement** | The category Intus owns. Movement with awareness and purpose through the full day. | \"Designed for Intentional Movement\" |\n| **Hybrid Athlete** | Intus's target customer. Someone who moves between gym, studio, street, and social life. | \"Built for the Hybrid Athlete\" |\n| **The Within** | The inner space where intention begins. Brand philosophy shorthand. | \"It starts from Within\" |\n| **Transition** | The moments between activities — leaving the studio, arriving at the cafe. Intus's signature moment. | Photography, content, and copy focus |\n\n### Forbidden Words (Never Use)\n\n| Word/Phrase | Why | Replace With |\n|-------------|-----|-------------|\n| \"Buttery soft\" | Generic activewear cliche. Zero differentiation. | Describe the feeling: \"moves with you\" / \"second-skin feel\" |\n| \"Squat-proof\" | Performance jargon. Reduces brand to gym context. | \"Built for your full day\" |\n| \"Sweat-wicking\" | Technical commodity language. | \"Designed to perform from studio to street\" |\n| \"Hustle\" / \"Grind\" / \"Beast mode\" | Hero archetype — belongs to Gymshark/LSKD. | \"Move with intention\" / \"Your practice, your pace\" |\n| \"No excuses\" / \"No days off\" | Toxic fitness culture. Contradicts Sage philosophy. | \"Every movement counts\" |\n| \"Buttery\" / \"Silky\" / \"Luxe\" | Sensory Lover archetype — belongs to STAX. | \"Considered\" / \"Refined\" / \"Precise\" |\n| \"Sale\" / \"Discount\" / \"% off\" | Undermines Magician alchemy. You don't discount magic. | N/A — Intus does not run sales |\n| \"Best\" / \"Leading\" / \"#1\" | Unsubstantiated claims. Breaks Sage authenticity. | Show, don't claim. Let studio partnerships and UGC speak. |\n| \"Eco-friendly\" (as standalone) | Vague sustainability language. | Specific: \"Made with recycled polyester\" or \"Certified by [X]\" |\n| \"Click here\" / \"Submit\" | Dead-end UX language. | \"Get Your Kit\" / \"Start Your Practice\" / \"Join the Circle\" |\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Visual Strategy\n\n### Positioning Tier: Elevated Mid-Range (Between Mass and Luxury)\n\nIntus sits in a specific visual territory — not luxury (that's Vuori, Alo Yoga), not mass (that's Echt, Shein), but **elevated essential**. The visual system must signal quality and intention without signaling inaccessibility.\n\n| Visual Code | Luxury | Intus (Elevated Mid-Range) | Mass |\n|-------------|--------|---------------------------|------|\n| Whitespace | 60%+ | 45-55% | 30-40% |\n| Color palette | 2-3 colors, muted | 3-4 colors, warm neutrals + 1 accent | 5+ colors, saturated |\n| Typography | Serif, custom | Clean sans-serif, geometric | Bold sans-serif, condensed |\n| Photography | Editorial, aspirational | Lifestyle-transitional, natural light | Product-focused, studio lit |\n| Grid | Asymmetric, art-directed | Modular, consistent | Dense, information-heavy |\n\n### Archetype Visual Expression\n\n**Magician (Primary — 70%):**\n- Transformative visual moments (before/after perspective, not body)\n- Warm tonal shifts (light → shadow, indoor → outdoor)\n- Elements that suggest alchemy (two things becoming one — The Kit)\n- Circular/flowing geometry (cycles, transitions, continuity)\n\n**Sage (Secondary — 30%):**\n- Clean, considered composition with intentional negative space\n- Quiet confidence — no visual noise\n- Typography-forward layouts for editorial/educational content\n- Restrained palette (wisdom = restraint)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Color System\n\n### Primary Palette\n\n| Color | Name | Hex | Psychology | Usage |\n|-------|------|-----|-----------|-------|\n| Deep Charcoal | **Within** | #2C2C2C | Depth, grounding, sophistication without pretension | Primary text, logo, headers |\n| Warm White | **Canvas** | #F5F0EB | Openness, warmth, invitation (not clinical white) | Backgrounds, breathing space |\n| Warm Sand | **Ground** | #D4C5B2 | Earth, stability, natural movement | Secondary backgrounds, cards, dividers |\n\n### Accent Palette\n\n| Color | Name | Hex | Psychology | Usage |\n|-------|------|-----|-----------|-------|\n| Burnt Terracotta | **Intention** | #C4704E | Warmth, energy, transformation — Magician's fire | CTAs, highlights, \"Get Your Kit\" buttons |\n| Deep Sage | **Thought** | #7A8B7A | Wisdom, nature, grounded philosophy — Sage's voice | Secondary accents, educational content, tags |\n\n### Extended Palette (Seasonal)\n\n| Color | Name | Hex | Usage |\n|-------|------|-----|-------|\n| Soft Clay | **Dawn** | #E8D5C4 | Seasonal Kit colorways, packaging |\n| Deep Navy | **Depth** | #1E2A3A | Men's collection emphasis, winter seasonal |\n\n### Color Ratios\n\n| Context | 60% (Dominant) | 30% (Secondary) | 10% (Accent) |\n|---------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Website | Canvas (#F5F0EB) | Within (#2C2C2C) + Ground (#D4C5B2) | Intention (#C4704E) |\n| Email | Canvas | Within | Intention (CTA only) |\n| Social | Ground or Canvas | Within | Intention |\n| Packaging | Canvas + Ground | Within | Intention (interior detail) |\n\n### Color Rules\n\n- **Never** use pure white (#FFFFFF) — always Canvas (#F5F0EB) for warmth\n- **Never** use pure black (#000000) — always Within (#2C2C2C) for depth without harshness\n- **Never** use Intention (terracotta) for body text — accent only\n- **Never** use more than 3 colors in a single composition\n- Thought (sage green) is reserved for Sage-expression contexts: educational content, philosophy sections, editorial\n- All color combinations must pass WCAG AA contrast minimum (4.5:1 for text)\n\n### Contrast Verification\n\n| Pair | Ratio | WCAG |\n|------|-------|------|\n| Within on Canvas | 11.2:1 | AAA |\n| Within on Ground | 5.8:1 | AA |\n| Canvas on Within | 11.2:1 | AAA |\n| Intention on Canvas | 4.6:1 | AA |\n| Intention on Within | 3.1:1 | Decorative use only |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Logo System\n\n### Design Direction\n\nThe Intus logo should embody: transformation, interiority, and the dissolving of boundaries (Magician) with considered restraint (Sage).\n\n**Logo Construction Framework:**\n\n| Element | Direction | Rationale |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| Wordmark | Clean geometric sans-serif. Custom letterforms for \"I\" and \"S\". | Sage clarity + Magician subtlety. The custom letters carry hidden meaning. |\n| Logomark (optional) | Abstract circle with interior movement — suggesting \"within\" | Magician (internal transformation). Circle = wholeness, continuity, the full day. |\n| Construction grid | Golden Ratio (phi) proportions for letter spacing and mark | Mathematical precision = Sage credibility |\n\n**Logo Variations Required:**\n\n| Variant | Use Case |\n|---------|----------|\n| Primary (wordmark + mark) | Website header, packaging, hero placements |\n| Wordmark only | Social profiles, email headers, small applications |\n| Mark only | Favicon, app icon, embroidery, repeat patterns |\n| Reversed (Canvas on Within) | Dark backgrounds, photography overlays |\n| Monochrome (Within only) | Print, embossing, single-color applications |\n\n**Logo Clear Space:** Minimum clear space = height of the \"I\" in \"INTUS\" on all sides.\n\n**Logo Minimum Size:** 24px height (digital), 10mm height (print).\n\n**Logo Don'ts:**\n- Never stretch, rotate, or distort\n- Never place on busy/patterned backgrounds without sufficient contrast\n- Never add effects (shadows, gradients, outlines)\n- Never change the color palette\n- Never recreate in a non-approved typeface\n\n---\n\n## 4. Typography System\n\n### Type Scale (Modular Scale: 1.25 ratio — Major Third)\n\n| Level | Size (px) | Weight | Use |\n|-------|-----------|--------|-----|\n| Display | 48 / 3rem | Light (300) | Hero headlines, manifesto text |\n| H1 | 38 / 2.375rem | Regular (400) | Page titles |\n| H2 | 30 / 1.875rem | Regular (400) | Section headers |\n| H3 | 24 / 1.5rem | Medium (500) | Subsection headers |\n| Body | 16 / 1rem | Regular (400) | Paragraph text, descriptions |\n| Body Small | 14 / 0.875rem | Regular (400) | Captions, metadata |\n| Micro | 12 / 0.75rem | Medium (500) | Labels, tags, legal |\n\n### Font Selection Direction\n\n| Role | Direction | Rationale |\n|------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Primary (Headlines)** | Geometric sans-serif with humanist warmth (e.g., Neue Montreal, General Sans, or Satoshi) | Magician: geometric precision suggests transformation through design. Sage: clean legibility signals thoughtfulness. Humanist warmth prevents clinical coldness. |\n| **Secondary (Body)** | Inter or system sans-serif | Maximum readability. Sage: clarity over decoration. |\n\n**Typography Rules:**\n- Line height: 1.5 for body, 1.2 for headlines\n- Letter spacing: +0.02em for all-caps micro text, 0 for body, -0.01em for display\n- Maximum line width: 65-75 characters for body text\n- Never use italic for emphasis — use Medium weight instead\n- Never use ALL CAPS for more than 3 words consecutively (except micro labels)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Photography Direction\n\n### The Signature Moment: Transition\n\nThe Intus visual language captures **the space between** — the moment of leaving, arriving, transitioning. This is the Magician's territory: dissolving the boundary between \"workout\" and \"life.\"\n\n### Shot Types\n\n| Shot Type | Description | Archetype | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------|\n| **The Transition** | Subject moving between environments — leaving the studio door, sitting at a cafe, walking down a street | Magician | Walking out of a Pilates studio into morning light, Kit visible, bag over shoulder |\n| **The Full Day** | Time-lapse or sequence showing the same Kit across multiple activities | Magician | 4-panel: reformer → coffee → walking → evening stretch |\n| **The Detail** | Close-up of fabric, stitching, or design detail with natural light | Sage | Fabric texture caught in afternoon light, fingers touching seam |\n| **The Collective** | Two or more Hybrid Athletes together in a non-gym setting | Sage/Magician | Friends in Kits at a cafe table, post-studio, natural and candid |\n\n### Photography Rules\n\n| Rule | Rationale |\n|------|-----------|\n| **Natural light only.** No studio flash, no ring lights. | Magician: natural light creates transformation (golden hour, morning light). Sage: honesty — no artificial enhancement. |\n| **Location: always in transition.** Doorways, streets, cafes, parks — never inside a gym. | The Kit is for the full day. Gym photography contradicts the POV. |\n| **Subjects: mid-movement or just-arrived.** Never static poses, never \"looking at camera and smiling.\" | Magician: movement = transformation. Sage: candid = authentic. |\n| **Wardrobe: always The Kit.** Never styled with non-Intus pieces in hero shots. | The Kit is the identity. Mixing dilutes the alchemy. |\n| **Diversity: reflect the Hybrid Athlete.** Multiple body types, ethnicities, genders. No fitness-model casting. | Sage: wisdom doesn't discriminate. Magician: transformation is for everyone. |\n| **Color grading: warm, slightly desaturated.** Match the Canvas/Ground palette. | Consistent visual temperature. Never cold/blue-toned (clinical). Never oversaturated (mass-market). |\n| **Never show price or promotional text on photography.** | Magician: you don't put a price tag on magic. Sage: photography is for meaning, not selling. |\n\n### Mood References\n\n| Mood | Visual Language |\n|------|----------------|\n| Melbourne morning | Cool light warming to gold. Empty streets. A figure walking with purpose. |\n| Post-studio calm | Slight perspiration. Hair up. Coffee in hand. Sitting outside. Natural. |\n| Evening transition | Golden hour. A stretch on the balcony. Movement slowing down. |\n| The collective | Friends together, not performing. Laughter. Walking. Real moments. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Packaging Specifications\n\n### Packaging Philosophy: Unboxing as Ritual\n\nThe Kit arrives as a unified identity, not separate items in a bag. The packaging IS the Magician's reveal — two items become one Kit through the unboxing experience.\n\n| Element | Specification | Rationale |\n|---------|---------------|-----------|\n| **Outer mailer** | Matte finish, Ground (#D4C5B2) base, Within (#2C2C2C) wordmark | Matte = naturalness, trust (not glossy mass-market). Ground color = warmth. |\n| **Interior** | Canvas (#F5F0EB) tissue paper, single printed line: \"The power is within.\" | Magician reveal. The message is discovered, not displayed. |\n| **Kit wrap** | Both Kit pieces wrapped together (not separately) in a single band | Alchemy: two items presented as one identity. The Kit is ONE product. |\n| **Kit band** | Terracotta (#C4704E) paper band with Kit name printed | Accent color at the moment of reveal. \"The Reformer Kit\" — identity, not SKU. |\n| **Insert** | Card stock, 100x150mm: \"Your Kit. Your day. Move with intention.\" + care instructions on reverse | Sage: considered, useful. Not a promotional flyer. |\n| **Material** | Recycled cardstock, soy-based inks, no plastic | Sustainability as baseline (per Phase 1A intelligence), not selling point. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Integration Outputs to Downstream Departments\n\n| To | Output |\n|----|--------|\n| **Digital & Systems** | Color tokens (hex values), typography scale, 8pt grid specs, button styles (Intention terracotta), photography specs for web implementation. |\n| **Distribution & Growth** | Social media visual templates, photography direction for content shoots, packaging unboxing sequence for UGC potential. |\n| **Narrative & Verbal** | Visual-verbal alignment confirmed: warm neutral palette matches assured/warm voice. Terracotta accent matches Magician transformation energy. |\n\n---\n\n*Deliverable 7 of 16 — Intus Launch Kit*\n*Next: Design System (Deliverable 8)*\n"

      "content": "# Semiotic Dictionary — Intus\n**Department:** Creative & Visual Arts Studio\n**Phase:** 3B | Launch Kit\n**Date:** February 2026\n\n---\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis dictionary maps every visual and verbal sign in the Intus brand system to its intended meaning. It ensures semiotic consistency — that every signifier (what customers see/hear) triggers the correct signified (what they understand/feel). If a sign points to the wrong meaning, the brand fractures.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Signs\n\n### The Brand Name\n\n| Sign | Signifier | Signified | Type |\n|------|-----------|-----------|------|\n| **\"Intus\"** | Latin word, unfamiliar but pronounceable | Inner power, hidden depth, something beneath the surface. Not foreign — foundational. | Symbol (arbitrary convention, requires learning) |\n| **\"Within\"** | Preposition of interiority | The source is inside you, not external. Self-reliance without isolation. | Index (causal: \"within\" → internal origin) |\n\n**Semiotic Risk:** If \"Intus\" is never explained, it reads as generic brand gibberish. The Latin origin MUST be communicated early (About page, welcome email, packaging insert) to activate the Magician signified.\n\n### The Kit\n\n| Sign | Signifier | Signified | Type |\n|------|-----------|-----------|------|\n| **\"The Kit\"** (capitalized) | A curated set, unified by name | Identity product, not a bundle discount. You don't \"buy two items\" — you \"get your Kit.\" | Symbol |\n| **Kit wrap band** (terracotta) | Two pieces bound together by a single band | Alchemy — two things becoming one. The transformation happens at the moment of unboxing. | Icon (visually represents unity) |\n| **Kit naming** (The Reformer Kit, The Street Kit) | Activity-based names | Each Kit has a purpose. Your Kit choice signals your practice, not your size or budget. | Index (name → lifestyle) |\n\n### The Category\n\n| Sign | Signifier | Signified | Type |\n|------|-----------|-----------|------|\n| **\"Intentional Movement\"** | Two-word phrase combining awareness + action | A new way to think about exercise — not performance, not punishment, but purposeful daily motion. | Symbol (category name — requires education) |\n| **\"The other 23 hours\"** | Numerical contrast (1 hour gym vs. 23 hours everything else) | The industry has it backwards. The majority of your day matters more than the workout. | Index (number → reframing) |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Color Signs\n\n| Color | Signifier | Signified | Cultural Code |\n|-------|-----------|-----------|---------------|\n| **Within (#2C2C2C)** | Deep charcoal, almost-black | Depth, grounding, sophistication. Not cold (it's warm charcoal, not cool gray). Not aggressive (it's not pure black). | Premium-accessible. Serious without being intimidating. |\n| **Canvas (#F5F0EB)** | Warm off-white | Openness, invitation, natural warmth. Not clinical (that's #FFFFFF). Not blank — warm, like a canvas waiting for intention. | Wellness/natural — aligns with Pilates studio aesthetics, not hospital or tech-sterile. |\n| **Ground (#D4C5B2)** | Warm sand/clay | Earth, stability, foundation. The physical ground beneath movement. | Melbourne aesthetic — urban neutral, not beach/coastal (that's Vuori). |\n| **Intention (#C4704E)** | Burnt terracotta | Transformation energy, warmth, the spark that initiates change. Magician's fire. | Action without aggression. Warmth without excess. Not red (urgency/danger) — terracotta is red that's been tempered by earth. |\n| **Thought (#7A8B7A)** | Deep sage green | Wisdom, nature, philosophy. The Sage's color. | Natural intelligence. Not neon/fresh green (health food) — deep and considered. |\n\n### Color Pairing Semiotics\n\n| Pairing | Reads As | Use |\n|---------|----------|-----|\n| Within + Canvas | Authority with warmth (Sage-forward) | Body text, editorial, educational content |\n| Canvas + Intention | Invitation to transform (Magician-forward) | CTAs, hero sections, product highlights |\n| Ground + Within | Grounded stability (foundation) | Secondary sections, card backgrounds |\n| Canvas + Thought | Quiet wisdom | Philosophy content, \"Movement Guide\" |\n| Within + Intention | Energized depth | Accent moments, Kit reveals, packaging details |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Typography Signs\n\n| Element | Signifier | Signified |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Geometric sans-serif (headlines)** | Clean, mathematical letterforms | Precision with warmth. Designed, not decorated. Magician: intentional construction. |\n| **Light weight (display)** | Thin strokes, breathing space | Confidence through restraint. You don't need to shout. Sage: quiet authority. |\n| **Medium weight (emphasis)** | Slightly heavier than body, not bold | Considered emphasis. Not aggressive (bold) — intentional. |\n| **ALL CAPS (micro labels)** | Small text in uppercase | Functional, structured. Used sparingly = signals importance. Overused = loses meaning. |\n| **Generous line height (1.5)** | Text breathes, doesn't crowd | Intentionality extends to reading experience. Nothing is rushed. |\n\n### What Typography NEVER Signals\n\n| Never | Because |\n|-------|---------|\n| Italic | Suggests uncertainty or aside — breaks Magician assurance |\n| Bold (heavy weights) | Suggests aggression — Hero archetype territory |\n| Script/handwritten | Suggests casualness or femininity — too narrow, breaks dual-gender positioning |\n| Condensed type | Suggests urgency or information density — mass-market code |\n| Decorative type | Suggests playfulness — Jester territory |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Photography Signs\n\n| Visual Element | Signifier | Signified |\n|----------------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Natural light** | Sun, window light, golden hour | Authenticity. Nothing hidden, nothing manufactured. Sage: truth needs no studio lighting. |\n| **Transition moments** | Doorways, streets between locations, arriving/leaving | The in-between IS the point. Magician: boundaries dissolve. This is where Intus lives. |\n| **Warm color grade** | Slightly desaturated, warm tones | Comfort without artifice. Not cold/editorial (luxury) or oversaturated (mass). |\n| **Candid subjects** | Not posing, not performing, mid-movement | Real life, not a photoshoot. Sage: authenticity. The subject doesn't know they're being watched — or doesn't care. |\n| **Empty space around subject** | Person occupies 40-60% of frame | Room to breathe. Intentional composition. The space IS part of the message. |\n| **Two contexts in one frame** | Gym bag + coffee cup. Studio door + street. | The Hybrid Athlete doesn't choose between worlds. The Kit bridges them. |\n\n### What Photography NEVER Shows\n\n| Never | Because |\n|-------|---------|\n| Gym interiors | Contradicts \"the other 23 hours\" POV. Intus is not gym-wear. |\n| Mirror selfies | Social media cliche. Breaks Sage authenticity. |\n| Posed fitness shots | Hero archetype territory (Gymshark, LSKD). |\n| Body close-ups | Lover archetype territory (STAX). Intus is about movement, not body. |\n| Pure white backgrounds | Clinical, e-commerce generic. Use Canvas or natural settings. |\n| Price overlays on images | You don't put a price tag on magic. Keep commerce and photography separate. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Material Signs\n\n| Material | Signifier | Signified | Use |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|-----|\n| **Matte cardstock (packaging)** | Smooth, non-reflective surface | Naturalness, trust, considered quality. Not glossy (mass-market). | Mailer, inserts, Kit band |\n| **Recycled stock** | Visible fiber texture, slightly imperfect | Intentional sustainability — not performed, embodied. | All paper/card materials |\n| **Terracotta accent (Kit band)** | A warm color reveal inside neutral packaging | The Magician's moment — the transformation is discovered inside, not displayed outside. | Kit band around paired items |\n| **Fabric (product)** | Mid-weight, structured-but-soft hand feel | \"Designed for a full day\" — not too technical (gym), not too loose (loungewear). The feel confirms the positioning. | The Kit itself |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Verbal Signs\n\n| Word/Phrase | Signifier | Signified |\n|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| **\"Get Your Kit\"** | Imperative + possessive | This is already yours — you're claiming it, not buying it. Magician: the Kit was always meant for you. |\n| **\"Move with intention\"** | Verb + preposition + noun | Movement is a practice with purpose, not a chore or performance. Sage: awareness transforms action. |\n| **\"The power is within\"** | Declarative, present tense | Transformation doesn't require external products — it starts inside. The brand gives you permission, not power. |\n| **\"Join the Circle\"** | Community metaphor | Equality (circle = no hierarchy). Belonging without exclusion. Not a \"team\" (hierarchical) or \"squad\" (casual). |\n| **\"From studio to street\"** | Spatial transition | The Kit bridges environments. Your life is one continuous flow. Magician: boundaries dissolve. |\n| **\"The other 23\"** | Numerical contrast | Reframes the industry's obsession with the workout hour. 23 > 1. The majority wins. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Anti-Semiotic Audit — Signs That Contradict the Brand\n\n| Sign | What It Signals | Why It Contradicts Intus |\n|------|----------------|-------------------------|\n| \"SALE\" or \"% OFF\" | Desperation, overstock, low confidence | Magician's alchemy is devalued. You don't discount transformation. |\n| Pure black (#000000) | Harshness, absolutism | Intus is warm depth (Within #2C2C2C), not cold authority. |\n| Pure white (#FFFFFF) | Clinical, sterile | Intus is warm invitation (Canvas #F5F0EB), not hospital. |\n| Glossy packaging | Mass-market, artificial, disposable | Contradicts Sage naturalness and sustainability. |\n| Gym photography | Performance culture, body obsession | Contradicts \"the other 23 hours\" and Sage anti-hustle positioning. |\n| Bold/heavy type | Aggression, shouting, urgency | Hero archetype. Intus speaks with Sage assurance, not Hero volume. |\n| Countdown timers | Manufactured urgency, scarcity manipulation | Fake scarcity breaks Sage trust permanently. |\n| \"Best seller\" badge | Conformity pressure, generic retail | Intus curates, not ranks. Every Kit is intentional, not popular. |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Semiotic Consistency Checklist\n\nBefore any new asset goes live, verify:\n\n- [ ] Every color used maps to the defined palette and its intended signified\n- [ ] Photography shows transition moments, not gym/static/posed\n- [ ] Typography weights stay within Light-Medium range (no Bold)\n- [ ] All copy uses approved vocabulary (check Word Bank in Deliverable 6)\n- [ ] No forbidden words appear anywhere in the asset\n- [ ] Material choices match the signified (matte not gloss, recycled not virgin)\n- [ ] The Kit is presented as one identity, never as \"two items for $X\"\n- [ ] No price appears on or overlaid on photography\n- [ ] Warm tone maintained (no cool/blue color grading)\n- [ ] Customer is Hero, brand is Guide (check Me/You ratio if copy-heavy)\n\n---\n\n*Deliverable 9 of 16 — Intus Launch Kit*\n*Next: Gate 3 — Identity Review*\n"

Z-pattern for single-goal pages. |\n| Scroll indicator below fold | Prevents Illusion of Completeness. Teases Kit section below. |\n| Kit cards before individual products | The Kit is the identity purchase. Individual pieces are secondary. |\n| Social proof after Kits | Validates the Kit concept before asking for deeper engagement. |\n| POV section mid-page | Mid-scroll engagement point. Sage content builds understanding. |\n| Trust signals as distinct strip | DTC trust gap (from Phase 1A) — 60-day guarantee is the #1 signal. |\n| UGC before email signup | Social proof → trust → willingness to subscribe. |\n\n### 3.2 Kit Product Page\n\n**Layout Pattern:** Asymmetric Split (60% visual / 40% content)\n\n```\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│ NAV                                               │\n├──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                                  │\n│  ┌─────────────────┐  THE REFORMER KIT           │\n│  │                 │                              │\n│  │  Kit Image      │  Zyra Tank + Core Shorts    │\n│  │  (both pieces   │                              │\n│  │  styled as one) │  $100 AUD                    │\n│  │                 │  or $25/fortnight with        │\n│  │  [thumbnails    │  Afterpay                    │\n│  │   below for     │                              │\n│  │   angle views]  │  Color: [swatches]            │\n│  │                 │  Size:  [selector]            │\n│  └─────────────────┘                              │\n│                      [Get This Kit]               │\n│                                                  │\n│                      60-day guarantee.             │\n│                      Wear it.

Lazy load below-fold images. |\n| **INP** | ≤ 200ms | Minimize JavaScript. Defer non-critical scripts. No render-blocking resources. |\n| **CLS** | ≤ 0.1 | Define image dimensions in HTML. Font swap: optional. Reserve space for dynamic content. |\n\n### Performance Checklist\n\n- [ ] All images served as WebP with srcset for responsive sizes\n- [ ] Hero image/video preloaded in `<head>`\n- [ ] Fonts loaded with `font-display: swap` or `optional`\n- [ ] Third-party scripts (Afterpay, analytics, chat) deferred or async\n- [ ] Shopify theme: remove unused apps/scripts from theme.liquid\n- [ ] CDN enabled for all static assets\n- [ ] Gzip/Brotli compression enabled\n\n---\n\n## 6. Accessibility Audit (WCAG AA)\n\n### Compliance Requirements\n\n| Requirement | Standard | Status |\n|-------------|----------|--------|\n| Text contrast | 4.5:1 minimum (Within on Canvas = 11.2:1) | Designed to pass |\n| Large text contrast | 3:1 minimum | Designed to pass |\n| Touch targets | 44x44px minimum | Specified in Design System |\n| Alt text | All product and lifestyle images | Required |\n| Heading hierarchy | h1 → h2 → h3, no skips | Specified in wireframes |\n| Keyboard navigation | All interactive elements Tab-accessible | Required |\n| Focus indicators | 2px Intention color outline | Specified in Design System |\n| Form labels | Visible labels (not placeholder-only) | Specified in Design System |\n| Screen reader | Semantic HTML, ARIA where needed | Required |\n| Reduced motion | Respect prefers-reduced-motion | Specified in Design System |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Shopify-Specific Recommendations\n\n| Area | Recommendation |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Theme** | Use a lightweight, performant theme (Dawn-based or minimal custom). Avoid bloated multipurpose themes. |\n| **Apps** | Minimize app count — each app adds JavaScript. Essential: Reviews (Judge.me), BNPL (Afterpay), Email (Klaviyo), Analytics (GA4 + server-side). |\n| **Product structure** | Create \"Kit\" products as bundles (not individual items in cart). Customer sees and buys ONE Kit product. |\n| **Metafields** | Use Shopify metafields for Kit-specific data: Kit name, included items, lifestyle context, recommended for. |\n| **URL structure** | /kits/reformer-kit, /women/zyra-leggings — clean, descriptive, SEO-friendly. |\n| **Checkout** | Use Shopify Checkout Extensibility (not checkout.liquid). Customize with brand colors and \"Complete Your Kit\" CTA. |\n| **Returns** | Integrate return portal (Loop or Returnly) with 60-day policy. Self-service to reduce support load. |\n| **Tracking** | Server-side events via Shopify + GA4 Measurement Protocol. Don't rely solely on client-side pixels. |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Integration Outputs to Downstream Departments\n\n| To | Output |\n|----|--------|\n| **Distribution & Growth** | Site structure for SEO. Content hub (\"/the-movement\") for organic. Email signup placement for list building. Kit Quiz for lead generation. |\n| **Narrative & Verbal** | All microcopy implemented per Deliverable 6. UX copy confirmed across wireframes. |\n| **Creative & Visual** | Design System tokens implemented per Deliverable 8. Photography placement defined per wireframes. |\n\n---\n\n*Deliverable 10 of 16 — Intus Launch Kit*\n*Next: Gate 4 — Digital Review*\n"

      "content": "# Content Strategy & Channel Plan — Intus\n**Department:** Distribution & Growth Engine\n**Phase:** 5A | Launch Kit\n**Date:** February 2026\n\n---\n\n## 1. Channel Strategy\n\n### Channel Selection (Based on Audience + Goal)\n\n| Channel | Role | Priority | Rationale |\n|---------|------|----------|-----------|\n| **TikTok** | Discovery + Virality | PRIMARY | Gen Z/Millennial Hybrid Athlete lives here. Completion rate > follower count. \"POV\" format is native. Interest-based algo means zero followers can still reach millions. |\n| **Instagram** | Lifestyle Affinity + Social Proof | PRIMARY | Aesthetic branding home. Saves & Sends = 5x more valuable than likes. UGC (#MyIntusKit) gallery. Studio partnership co-content. |\n| **YouTube** | Trust + Search + Long-form | SECONDARY | \"The Within Story\" documentary anchor. Movement Philosophy content for Sage expression. SEO value compounds. Shorts as bridge to long-form. |\n| **Email/SMS (Klaviyo)** | Lifecycle + Retention | PRIMARY | Owned channel — not algorithmic. Welcome sequence, Kit Quiz follow-up, post-purchase nurture. Most Sage-forward channel (60/40 Magician/Sage). |\n| **Pinterest** | Visual Discovery + Intent | TERTIARY | \"Activewear outfit\" search intent. Kit styling boards. Long content lifespan. Low priority at launch, grow post-month-3. |\n\n### Channels NOT Used at Launch\n\n| Channel | Why Not |\n|---------|---------|\n| Facebook | Declining Gen Z presence. Budget better spent on TikTok/Instagram. Reassess month 6. |\n| LinkedIn | Not a lifestyle/consumer channel. Only for B2B partnerships (studios, wholesale). |\n| X/Twitter | Not aligned with brand energy. External links penalized 50-90%. Reassess if cultural conversation shifts. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Content Architecture: Hub-and-Spoke Flywheel\n\n### The Hub: Weekly Anchor Content\n\nOne major content piece per week drives the flywheel. All spoke content derives from it.\n\n| Week Type | Hub Content | Channel | Spoke Outputs |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|---------------|\n| **Philosophy Week** | Movement Philosophy article/video (\"Why every movement counts\") | YouTube long-form + Blog | 5 TikToks, 3 Reels, 2 carousel posts, 1 email |\n| **Kit Week** | Kit spotlight + styling guide (\"3 Ways to Wear The Reformer Kit\") | Instagram Reels + Blog | 5 TikToks, 3 IG posts, 1 YouTube Short, 1 email |\n| **Community Week** | UGC compilation + studio partner feature | Instagram + TikTok | 3 IG posts, 3 TikToks, 1 YouTube Short, 1 email |\n| **Founder Week** | \"The Within Story\" chapter / behind-the-scenes | YouTube + Instagram | 5 TikToks, 3 Reels, 2 IG Stories, 1 email |\n\n**Target: 1 hub → 15-20 spokes per week = 60-80 pieces of content per month from 4 hubs.**\n\n### Content Pillars (Mapped to Archetype)\n\n| Pillar | Archetype | Content Examples | Ratio |\n|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------|\n| **The Transformation** | Magician (primary) | POV transitions, Kit reveals, before/after perspective shifts | 40% |\n| **The Philosophy** | Sage (secondary) | Movement philosophy, \"the other 23 hours\" essays, mindful movement guides | 25% |\n| **The Community** | Both | UGC, studio features, \"What's In My Kit\", customer stories | 25% |\n| **The Product** | Magician | Kit spotlights, fabric stories, new colorway drops | 10% |\n\n**Note: Product content is only 10%. Intus sells meaning, not merch. The Kit sells itself when the philosophy lands.**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Platform-Specific Content Formats\n\n### TikTok (5-7 posts/week)\n\n| Format | Hook (First 1.5s) | Structure | Length |\n|--------|-------------------|-----------|--------|\n| **POV: Transition** | \"POV: You stop changing clothes 3 times a day\" | Day-in-the-life: studio → coffee → street in one Kit | 15-30s |\n| **The Question** | \"The activewear question nobody asks\" | Text reveal → \"What do you wear between workouts?\" → Kit reveal | 10-15s |\n| **What's In My Kit** | Person holds up Kit pieces | Quick styling + \"This is my [Reformer/Street/Recovery] Kit\" | 15-20s |\n| **Philosophy Drop** | Provocative statement on screen | \"Your gym clothes weren't designed for your day\" → short essay | 30-60s |\n| **Sound trend remix** | Trending audio + Intus-relevant visual | Adapt trending format to transition/Kit narrative | 10-30s |\n\n**TikTok Rules:**\n- Hook in first 1.5s (visual change or text)\n- Visual change every 3 seconds (3-Second Rule)\n- End on payoff, cut immediately (Quit While Ahead)\n- No watermarks when reposting to Instagram\n- Completion rate > everything else\n\n### Instagram (4-5 posts/week + daily Stories)\n\n| Format | Type | Content |\n|--------|------|---------|\n| **Reels** | Video (15-60s) | Same as TikTok but re-edited (no TikTok watermark). Transition POVs, Kit styling. |\n| **Carousel** | 5-7 slides | \"The Philosophy of Intentional Movement\" / \"5 Signs You're a Hybrid Athlete\" / Kit lookbook |\n| **Single image** | Lifestyle photo | Transition moment photography (per Deliverable 7 photography direction) |\n| **Stories** | Daily | Behind-the-scenes, polls (\"Reformer or Street Kit?\"), studio partner features, repost UGC |\n\n**Instagram Rules:**\n- Saves & Sends are the primary metric (5x more valuable than likes)\n- Carousel posts get highest reach for educational content\n- Never post a TikTok with watermark\n- Stories: use polls/questions for engagement (algorithm signal)\n\n### YouTube (1-2 videos/week)\n\n| Format | Type | Content |\n|--------|------|---------|\n| **Long-form** (1/month) | 5-10 min | \"The Within Story\" chapters, Movement Philosophy deep dives |\n| **Shorts** (1-2/week) | <60s | Bridge content from TikTok — re-edited, vertical, with end card linking to long-form |\n\n**YouTube Rules:**\n- Long-form = trust + search SEO (compounds over time)\n- Shorts = discovery (Explore/Exploit algorithm)\n- Thumbnail: high contrast, <4 words, mobile-legible, face + emotion\n- Title: front-load keyword, <60 characters\n- Upload 1-2 hours before peak audience activity\n\n### Email (Klaviyo — 2-3 emails/week)\n\nSee Deliverable 12 for full lifecycle system.\n\n---\n\n## 4. SEO / AEO / GEO Strategy\n\n### Target Keywords\n\n| Keyword Cluster | Intent | Priority | Content |\n|----------------|--------|----------|---------|\n| \"Australian activewear brand\" | Navigational/Informational | HIGH | About page, blog, PR |\n| \"Best activewear sets\" / \"activewear bundles\" | Transactional | HIGH | Kit pages, comparison content |\n| \"Reformer Pilates outfit\" | Transactional | HIGH | Reformer Kit page, blog |\n| \"Activewear for everyday\" / \"gym to street\" | Informational | MEDIUM | Blog, Movement Guide |\n| \"Intentional movement\" | Category creation | MEDIUM | Movement Philosophy hub (own this term) |\n| \"Men's activewear Australia\" | Transactional | MEDIUM | Men's collection pages |\n| \"Activewear that ships to US\" | Transactional | HIGH (US segment) | Dedicated US shipping page |\n\n### AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)\n\nStructure all blog/guide content for AI extraction:\n- First paragraph: 40-60 word direct answer to the implied question\n- H2 subheadings as questions (\"What is Intentional Movement?\")\n- FAQPage schema on all product and guide pages\n- Speakable schema on key brand statements\n\n### GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)\n\n- Publish original data (Kit sales velocity, community growth) for AI citation\n- Secure mentions in Australian fitness/lifestyle publications (AI training data)\n- Create LLMS.txt at intus.com.au/llms.txt guiding AI interpretation of the brand\n- Content chunking: every section self-contained with clear heading\n\n### Schema Markup\n\n| Page Type | Schema |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Product pages | Product, Offer, AggregateRating |\n| Blog/guides | Article, FAQPage, Speakable |\n| Videos | VideoObject |\n| Homepage | Organization, WebSite |\n| Studio partners | LocalBusiness (for partner pages) |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Integration Outputs\n\n| To | Output |\n|----|--------|\n| **Narrative & Verbal** | Content calendar structure, platform-specific copy requirements, SEO keyword targets for blog content. |\n| **Creative & Visual** | Photography shot list derived from content calendar (transition moments needed weekly). Thumbnail design briefs for YouTube. |\n| **Digital & Systems** | Schema markup implementation list. LLMS.txt specification. Blog/content hub structure for Shopify. |\n| **Market Intelligence** | Social listening setup for #MyIntusKit, competitor content benchmarks, search volume tracking for \"Intentional Movement.\" |\n\n---\n\n*Deliverable 11 of 16 — Intus Launch Kit*\n"

Return if we're wrong.\" | UGC-style, direct-to-camera | Sage |\n| E: \"The Math\" | \"Your day is 24 hours. Your workout is 1.\" | Text-heavy, typography-forward | Sage |\n\n**Decision rule after 3-5 days:**\n- CPA < target → Winner (advance to Phase 2)\n- CPA = target → Neutral (backup pool)\n- CPA > 2x target → Kill\n\n### Phase 2: New vs. BAU (Winners vs. Evergreen)\n\n**Purpose:** Validate that new winners outperform current best performers.\n\n| Parameter | Setting |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Campaign type | ABO or CBO |\n| Budget | $30-50/day per ad set |\n| Duration | 5-7 days |\n| Structure | 2 ad sets: Phase 1 winners vs. current best performers |\n\n**Decision rule:**\n- New ad CPA < BAU CPA → New winner confirmed → advance to Phase 3\n- New ad CPA ≈ BAU CPA → Add to rotation (creative diversity)\n- New ad CPA > BAU CPA → Return to backup pool, don't scale\n\n### Phase 3: Scaling\n\n**Purpose:** Put validated winners into high-budget campaigns for acquisition.\n\n| Parameter | Setting |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Campaign type | CBO or ASC+ |\n| Budget | Scale gradually (increase 20-30% every 3-4 days) |\n| Monitoring | Daily CPA check. If CPA rises >30% for 3 consecutive days → reduce budget or rotate creative. |\n| Creative refresh | Every 3-4 weeks (or when frequency > 3-4 per user per week) |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Runoff Testing (Hidden Unicorn Discovery)\n\n**Problem:** Meta's algorithm sometimes gives zero spend to ads that could be winners — it just never tested them.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. After Phase 1, identify any ads with $0 or <$5 spend\n2. Move them to a dedicated \"Runoff\" ad set with forced equal budget distribution\n3. Run for 3 days at $20/day\n4. Check for hidden winners that the algorithm overlooked\n\n**This has historically surfaced 15-20% of eventual top performers that would have been killed as \"losers.\"**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Ad Fatigue Detection & Response\n\n### Fatigue Signals\n\n| Signal | Threshold | Action |\n|--------|-----------|--------|\n| CTR declining consistently | 3+ days of decline | Rotate creative |\n| CPM/CPC rising | >20% increase over baseline | Expand audience or rotate |\n| Frequency | >3-4 per user per week | Rotate creative, implement frequency caps |\n| CPA rising | >30% above target for 3+ days | Reduce budget, test new creative |\n\n### Creative Refresh Protocol\n\n**Monthly cycle:**\n- Week 1: Launch 3-5 new concepts (Phase 1 Pre-Flight)\n- Week 2: Test winners vs. BAU (Phase 2)\n- Week 3-4: Scale winners, monitor fatigue\n- End of month: Kill fatigued creative, prepare next batch\n\n**Creative diversity rule:** Always have 3+ active creatives in scaling campaigns. Never rely on a single ad.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Platform-Specific Ad Specs\n\n### Meta (Instagram + Facebook)\n\n| Placement | Format | Dimensions | Duration |\n|-----------|--------|------------|----------|\n| Feed | Video | 1:1 (1080x1080) or 4:5 (1080x1350) | 15-30s |\n| Stories/Reels | Video | 9:16 (1080x1920) | 15-30s |\n| Feed | Image | 1:1 (1080x1080) | Static |\n\n### TikTok\n\n| Placement | Format | Dimensions | Duration |\n|-----------|--------|------------|----------|\n| In-Feed | Video | 9:16 (1080x1920) | 15-60s |\n| TopView | Video | 9:16 | 5-60s |\n\n### YouTube\n\n| Placement | Format | Dimensions | Duration |\n|-----------|--------|------------|----------|\n| Shorts ads | Video | 9:16 | 15-60s |\n| In-stream (skippable) | Video | 16:9 | 15-30s (hook in first 5s before skip) |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Budget Allocation (Launch Month)\n\n### Recommended Monthly Budget: $2,000-$3,000 AUD\n\n| Channel | Allocation | Purpose |\n|---------|-----------|---------|\n| Meta (IG + FB) | 50% ($1,000-1,500) | Primary acquisition. Kit Quiz traffic + retargeting. |\n| TikTok | 30% ($600-900) | Discovery. Broad awareness. POV content amplification. |\n| YouTube | 10% ($200-300) | Retargeting only at launch. Scale post-month-3 with long-form. |\n| Testing reserve | 10% ($200-300) | Phase 1 Pre-Flight and Runoff testing. |\n\n### CAC Targets\n\n| Metric | Target | Rationale |\n|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Prospecting CAC (new customer) | < $30 AUD | Kit AOV = $100. 30% margin = $30 contribution. CAC must be below this. |\n| Retargeting CAC | < $15 AUD | Warm audience should convert at ~2x efficiency. |\n| Blended CAC | Track but don't optimize on | Blended hides true channel performance. Always layer. |\n| nROAS (new customer) | > 3x | New customer revenue / ad spend. The metric that matters. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Creative Rules (Brand Compliance)\n\n| Rule | Rationale |\n|------|-----------|\n| No discount language in ads | Magician rule: you don't discount magic. |\n| 60-day guarantee is the hook, not a coupon | The guarantee IS the conversion tool. |\n| Always show Kit as one product, not \"2 items for $100\" | Bundle-as-identity, not bundle-as-discount. |\n| UGC-style > polished studio | Gen Z trusts authenticity over production value. |\n| Transition moments in video, not gym footage | Brand photography direction (Deliverable 7). |\n| \"Get Your Kit\" CTA, not \"Shop Now\" | Consistent across all touchpoints (Deliverable 6). |\n\n---\n\n*Deliverable 13 of 16 — Intus Launch Kit*\n"

Measurement Architecture: Triangulated (Adapted for Early-Stage)\n\nIntus is pre-launch with no historical data. The triangulated framework (MMM + MTA + Incrementality) must be adapted for the early-stage reality while building toward full implementation.\n\n### Phase-Based Measurement Roadmap\n\n| Phase | Timeline | Methodology | What It Measures |\n|-------|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| **Phase A: Foundation** | Months 1-3 | Attribution + Event Tracking | What's happening? (baseline data collection) |\n| **Phase B: Validation** | Months 4-6 | Attribution + Incrementality Testing | Is it real? (causal validation of channels) |\n| **Phase C: Optimization** | Months 7-12+ | Full Triangulation (MMM + MTA + Incrementality) | How do we scale? (budget optimization) |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Phase A: Foundation (Months 1-3)\n\n### Tracking Infrastructure\n\n| Component | Implementation | Tool |\n|-----------|---------------|------|\n| Server-side events | Shopify + GA4 Measurement Protocol | GA4 + Shopify |\n| Client-side pixel | GA4 gtag.js + Meta Pixel + TikTok Pixel | Browser |\n| Email tracking | Klaviyo analytics + UTM parameters on all links | Klaviyo |\n| Studio attribution | UTM-tagged QR codes per studio location | GA4 |\n| Kit Quiz tracking | Event: quiz_start, quiz_complete, quiz_result | GA4 custom events |\n| Social tracking | Platform analytics + UTM on bio links | Native + GA4 |\n\n### Event Taxonomy\n\n| Event | Trigger | Parameters |\n|-------|---------|------------|\n| `page_view` | Any page load | page_title, page_location |\n| `view_item` | Product page view | item_id, item_name, item_category (Kit/Individual), price |\n| `quiz_start` | Kit Quiz initiated | source (ad/organic/studio) |\n| `quiz_complete` | Quiz result shown | kit_result (reformer/street/recovery) |\n| `add_to_cart` | Kit or item added | item_id, item_name, value, kit_type |\n| `begin_checkout` | Checkout started | value, items, payment_method |\n| `purchase` | Order completed | transaction_id, value, items, new_vs_returning, source |\n| `email_signup` | \"Join the Circle\" | source, segment |\n\n### Attribution Model (Phase A)\n\n**Model: Time Decay (7-day lookback)**\n\n| Why Time Decay | Rationale |\n|---------------|-----------|\n| Short consideration cycle | Activewear is typically 7-14 day decision for new brand |\n| Video-heavy channels | TikTok/Reels create awareness that decays toward conversion |\n| Multiple touchpoints | Hybrid Athlete encounters brand across social, email, studio |\n\n**Rules:**\n- Track nROAS (new customer revenue / ad spend), not blended ROAS\n- Never optimize on platform-reported conversions alone — cross-reference with Shopify\n- Always layer CAC: Prospecting CAC vs. Retargeting CAC (per Deliverable 13)\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Phase C: Full Triangulation (Months 7-12+)\n\nAt 6+ months with sufficient data:\n\n| Layer | Tool | Purpose |\n|-------|------|---------|\n| **MMM** | Lightweight MMM (Robyn or similar) | Top-down: How should total budget be allocated across channels? |\n| **MTA** | GA4 Data-Driven Attribution | Bottom-up: Which touchpoints drive individual conversions? |\n| **Incrementality** | Ongoing geo-lift and holdout tests | Validation: Are the other two models telling the truth? |\n\n**MMM Data Requirement:** 6+ months minimum, ideally 12+ months for seasonal effects.
