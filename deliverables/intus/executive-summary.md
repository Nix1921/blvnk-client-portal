# 1. EXECUTIVE BRIEF

## The Situation
Intus is an early-stage DTC activewear brand in Melbourne, competing in an $8.7B Australian market dominated by entrenched players (LSKD, Echt, STAX, Lorna Jane, Gymshark). The brand has no proprietary fabric, no physical retail, and no category ownership. Its current marketing uses generic activewear language ("buttery soft", bundle discounts) that places it directly into a Red Ocean of indistinguishable competitors.

## The Opportunity
The brand name ("Intus" = Latin for "within") contains a powerful, untapped asset: a philosophy of inner transformation. No competitor in the Australian activewear market occupies this space. By designing a new category — **Intentional Movement** — Intus can escape the feature-comparison game entirely and own the conversation about what movement means beyond the gym.

## The Strategic Position

| Element | Decision |
|---------|----------|
| **Category** | Intentional Movement (new — Intus creates and leads this) |
| **Positioning** | The brand for people who move with purpose through their full day |
| **Archetype** | Magician (70%) + Sage (30%) — transformation with wisdom |
| **Word Owned** | "Intentional" |
| **POV** | "What do you do between workouts?" |
| **Anchor Product** | The Kit — curated top + bottom, $100 AUD, always capitalized |
| **Pricing Rule** | No discounts, ever. You don't discount transformation. |
| **Channel** | TikTok + Instagram (primary), YouTube + Email (secondary) |
| **Launch** | Lightning Strike — 2-week concentrated push (Air Wars + Ground Wars) |
| **90-Day Revenue Target** | $50K–$80K AUD |

## The Three Rules
1. **The customer is always the Hero.** Intus is the Guide.
2. **Never discount The Kit.** Price integrity is a Magician signal.
3. **Never show gym interiors.** Intus lives in "the other 23 hours."

# 2. MARKET INTELLIGENCE

> *Full report: Deliverable 01 — Market Intelligence Report*

## Market Landscape

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Australian activewear market (2025) | $8.7B USD |
| Projected (2034) | $13.2B USD (CAGR 4.63%) |
| Mid-range DTC segment | ~$575M–$690M |
| Intus serviceable market (18-35, metro AU) | ~$200M–$250M |
| Intentional Movement addressable value | ~$216M (new category) |

## Target Audience: The Hybrid Athlete

| Attribute | Profile |
|-----------|---------|
| **Who** | Gen Z + Millennials (18-35), dual gender |
| **Where** | Melbourne (primary), Australian metro, US expansion (secondary) |
| **Behavior** | Transitions between reformer class, coffee, street, social — all in one day |
| **Pain** | Changes clothes 3+ times daily. No single wardrobe bridges gym and life. |
| **Want** | One Kit that works for the full day. Identity, not just clothing. |

## Three Audience Segments

| Segment | Description | Size Priority |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Hybrid Athlete Female (AU)** | 22-32, Pilates/yoga + social, Melbourne metro | Primary |
| **Conscious Male (AU)** | 25-35, gym + lifestyle, underserved by current market | Growth |
| **AU-Aesthetic Seeker (US)** | 20-30, drawn to Australian wellness aesthetic | Expansion |

# 3. COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS

> *Full report: Deliverable 02 — Competitive Dynamics Model & Strategy*

## Blue Ocean Position

No competitor occupies the Magician archetype in Australian activewear. Every brand is Hero (Gymshark, LSKD), Explorer (Vuori), Lover (STAX), or Caregiver (Lorna Jane). The "Intentional Movement" category is uncontested.

| Factor | Industry Norm | Intus |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Pricing mechanic | Volume bundles + discounts | **Eliminated** — The Kit is identity, not a deal |
| Fabric marketing | Proprietary names ("DreamKnit") | **Reduced** — fabric serves the Kit, doesn't lead |
| Category frame | "Activewear" / "Athleisure" | **Created** — "Intentional Movement" |
| Product unit | Individual pieces | **Created** — The Kit (curated pair) |
| Gym photography | Standard | **Eliminated** — transition moments only |
| Philosophy layer | None | **Created** — "The other 23 hours" |

## Competitive Rules
1. Never compare to competitors by name — attack the villain (gym-only activewear), not the players
2. The Kit reframe escapes the Prisoner's Dilemma on bundle discounting
3. Studio partnerships are Intus's "costly signal" — competitors can't fake authentic instructor wear

# 4. STRATEGY & PSYCHOLOGY

> *Full reports: Deliverable 03 — Strategic Positioning Brief, Deliverable 04 — Brand Archetype Guide*

## Archetype: Magician + Sage (70/30)

| Touchpoint | Magician Expression | Sage Expression |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Product | The Kit as "alchemy" — two pieces becoming one identity | Considered design, precise construction |
| Social | POV transitions, Kit reveals, transformation hooks | Philosophy drops, "the other 23 hours" essays |
| Email | Welcome → "You just joined something different" | Nurture → "The question no one asks" |
| Studio | Instructor wear as visible transformation | Studio as place of mindful practice |
| Packaging | Terracotta Kit band reveal — the magic is inside | Matte recycled stock — natural, honest |

## Behavioral Economics

| Lever | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| **Anchoring** | The Kit at $100 anchors value. Individual pieces ($45-$65) feel like a deal by comparison. |
| **Loss Aversion** | 60-day guarantee — "If it doesn't change how you dress, send it back." Framed as risk-free, triggers commitment. |
| **Sunk Cost** | Kit collection (Reformer, Street, Recovery) encourages building a personal system. Each Kit makes the next more valuable. |
| **Social Proof** | Studio partners + UGC (#MyIntusKit) over influencer endorsements. Authenticity > reach. |
| **Mental Accounting** | "$3.33/day for a Kit" reframe. Daily essentials framing, not fashion purchase. |

## FROTOS: Belief Shifts Required

| FROM (current belief) | TO (target belief) |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Activewear = gym clothes | Movement happens all day, not just at the gym |
| I need different clothes for different contexts | One Kit works everywhere |
| Bundles = discount deals | The Kit = curated identity |
| Solo Australian brand = risky | "Within" philosophy = trustworthy depth |

---

# 5. BRAND NARRATIVE & VOICE

> *Full reports: Deliverable 05 — BrandScript & Manifesto, Deliverable 06 — Tone of Voice Guide*

## BrandScript (StoryBrand SB7)

| Element | Intus |
|---------|-------|
| **Hero** | The Hybrid Athlete — moves between gym, studio, street, and social life |
| **Problem** | External: "I change clothes 3 times a day." Internal: "I feel like I'm performing for each context." Philosophical: "Clothing should move with your life, not segment it." |
| **Guide** | Intus — empathy ("We live the same day you do") + authority (The Kit, studio partnerships) |
| **Plan** | 1. Choose Your Kit. 2. Wear It Everywhere. 3. Move With Intention. |
| **CTA** | "Get Your Kit" (direct) / "Take the Kit Quiz" (transitional) |
| **Failure** | Another drawer full of gym clothes you only wear for one hour |
| **Success** | One Kit. Full day. No compromises. You stop performing and start moving. |

## One-Liner
> Most activewear is designed for one hour at the gym. Intus creates Kits for the other 23.

## Voice: Magician (70%) + Sage (30%)
Sounds like: a thoughtful friend who sees things differently. Assured but never arrogant. Quiet but never passive. Energy: 6/10 (rises to 7 for launches, drops to 5 for nurture).

## Word Banks

| Power Words (USE) | Forbidden Words (NEVER) |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Intentional, flow, transition, Kit | Buttery soft, squat-proof, hustle |
| Curated, ritual, practice, within | Beast mode, grind, no excuses |
| Shift, transform, reframe | Sale, discount, % off |
| Considered, crafted, refined | Best, leading, #1 |

## UX Language

| Action | Say | Never Say |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| Buy | "Get Your Kit" | "Buy Now", "Add to Cart" |
| Subscribe | "Join the Circle" | "Subscribe", "Sign Up" |
| Checkout | "Complete Your Kit" | "Place Order", "Submit" |

# 6. VISUAL IDENTITY SYSTEM

> *Full reports: Deliverable 07 — Brand Identity System, Deliverable 08 — Design System, Deliverable 09 — Semiotic Dictionary*

## Color System

| Color | Name | Hex | Meaning |
|-------|------|-----|---------|
| Deep Charcoal | **Within** | #2C2C2C | Depth, grounding — not cold (warm charcoal, not gray) |
| Warm White | **Canvas** | #F5F0EB | Invitation, warmth — not clinical (not pure white) |
| Warm Sand | **Ground** | #D4C5B2 | Earth, stability — Melbourne aesthetic |
| Burnt Terracotta | **Intention** | #C4704E | Transformation energy — Magician's fire |
| Deep Sage | **Thought** | #7A8B7A | Wisdom, philosophy — Sage's color |

**Rule:** Never use pure black (#000000) or pure white (#FFFFFF). Intus is warm, not clinical.

## Typography
- Headlines: Geometric sans-serif, Light/Medium weight (never Bold)
- Body: Inter or equivalent, Regular weight
- Line height: 1.5 (generous — nothing is rushed)
- Never: Italic, script, condensed, or decorative type

## Photography: "The Signature Moment: Transition"

| Show | Never Show |
|------|-----------|
| Natural light, golden hour | Studio/artificial lighting |
| Transition moments (studio → coffee → street) | Gym interiors |
| Candid subjects mid-movement | Posed fitness shots or mirror selfies |
| Two contexts in one frame (gym bag + coffee cup) | Body close-ups |
| 40-60% subject in frame (breathing room) | Price overlays on images |

## Packaging
- Matte cardstock (not glossy — glossy = mass market)
- Recycled stock with visible fiber texture
- Terracotta Kit band wrapping the two pieces together
- Interior message: "The power is within."

# 7. DIGITAL ARCHITECTURE

> *Full report: Deliverable 10 — Website UX Wireframes*

## Site Structure: Kit-First IA
Navigation leads with THE KITS (not Women's/Men's). The Kit is the entry point, not the category.

## Key Pages

| Page | Pattern | Key Element |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Homepage | Z-pattern | Hero → Kit cards → Social proof → POV → UGC → Email signup |
| Kit Product Page | Asymmetric 60/40 split | Kit shown as ONE product. Afterpay breakdown. Lifestyle strip. |
| Kit Quiz | 3 questions, stripped nav | Persona → result → email capture → Kit recommendation |
| Checkout | Guest-first, 3 steps | 7 fields max. "Complete Your Kit" CTA. |

## Trust Gap Remediation
Intus has no physical retail, so the site must close the trust gap digitally:
1. 60-day guarantee badge on every product page
2. Studio partnership logos
3. UGC gallery ("What's In My Kit")
4. Afterpay breakdown (reduces perceived risk)
5. Real-time "X people viewing this Kit" (if traffic supports)
6. Founder story on About page (brand = person)

## Performance Targets
- LCP ≤ 2.5s | CLS ≤ 0.1 | FID ≤ 100ms
- Mobile-first (65-70% expected traffic)
- WCAG AA accessibility
- Platform: Shopify (Dawn theme base)
