## Gate 1: Intelligence Review
**Date:** February 2026
**Deliverables Reviewed:** Market Intelligence Report (1A), Competitive Dynamics Model & Strategy (1B)
**Status:** PENDING REVIEW

### Quality Review (Applicable Sections)

| Section | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 1. Strategic Consistency | PASS | "Different vs. Better" problem clearly identified. Blue Ocean whitespace ("Intentional Movement") identified. Not competing on price — recommending category design. |
| 6. Measurement Integrity | PASS | Triangulated framework designed (MMM + MTA + Incrementality adapted for early-stage). nROAS tracked, not blended. No platform-reported data dependency. |
| 8. Competitive Robustness | PASS | Strategy survives Tremble Test — "The Kit" identity holds even if competitors adjust pricing. STAX US gap exploitation doesn't depend on competitor error. Pilates coalition is independently valuable. |

**Sections not yet applicable:** 2 (Archetype — TBD Phase 2), 3 (Narrative — TBD Phase 3), 4 (Visual — TBD Phase 3), 5 (Digital — TBD Phase 4), 7 (Distribution — TBD Phase 5)

### Gate 1 Score: 3/3 applicable sections PASS

---

### Gate 1 Feedback

**Confirmed:**
- Market sizing validated: $8.7B → $13.2B (CAGR 4.63%). Serviceable market ~$200-250M.
- Competitive landscape: 20+ brands mapped across 3 tiers. Direct rivals profiled with pricing, positioning, and moats.
- Game classification: Non-cooperative, simultaneous, repeated. Bundle wars = Prisoner's Dilemma.
- Blue Ocean whitespace: "Intentional Movement" territory is unoccupied.
- Category Design recommended over JTBD (Strategy dept should pursue this path).
- STAX US gap confirmed — strategic opportunity locked.
- Measurement framework: Triangulated, adapted for early-stage DTC.

**Adjusted:**
- (None — intelligence phase, no prior outputs to adjust)

**Added Context:**
- Pilates studios emerged as the #1 coalition opportunity — closes trust gap without physical retail.
- "The Kit" concept (bundle-as-identity) is the micro-innovation that reframes the pricing game.
- 60-day return policy is a high-priority costly signal — should be implemented pre-launch.
- Flexlara's 64% 90-day reorder rate is the retention benchmark to track against.
- Men's market between Gymshark ("gym-bro") and Vuori ("too expensive") is a specific whitespace for Intus.

## Gate 2: Strategy Review
**Date:** February 2026
**Deliverables Reviewed:** Strategic Positioning Brief & Category Blueprint (2A), Brand Archetype Guide (2B)
**Status:** PENDING REVIEW

### Quality Review (Applicable Sections)

| Section | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 1. Strategic Consistency | PASS | "Different vs. Better" audit explicit — Intus shifts from "better activewear" to "different relationship with movement." Category Design confirmed with clear Category Blueprint. "Intentional Movement" category defined, word ownership ("intentional") established. No zero-sum thinking — creating new category, not fighting for share. |
| 2. Archetype Alignment | PASS | Primary: Magician (20/20 score). Secondary: Sage (16/20). No opposing quadrant clash (Risk/Mastery + Independence/Fulfillment). 70/30 blend ratio defined per touchpoint. Competitive archetype map confirms Magician is completely unoccupied in AU activewear. Consistency rules (Always/Never) established. |
| 6. Measurement Integrity | PASS | FROTOS defined for 3 target audiences with specific belief shifts to measure. Lightning Strike success metrics defined (Kit sales, email growth, social reach, studio conversions, search volume, UGC). Carries forward Gate 1 triangulated framework. |
| 8. Competitive Robustness | PASS | Archetype survives Tremble Test — anchored in brand etymology ("Intus" = "within" = Magician). No competitor occupies Magician space. Category Design creates first-mover advantage in "Intentional Movement" sub-category. Behavioral economics layer (loss aversion via 60-day returns, sunk cost via Kit collection, anchoring via Kit pricing) creates structural lock-in. |

**Sections not yet applicable:** 3 (Narrative — TBD Phase 3), 4 (Visual — TBD Phase 3), 5 (Digital — TBD Phase 4), 7 (Distribution — TBD Phase 5)

### Gate 2 Score: 4/4 applicable sections PASS

---

### Gate 2 Feedback

**Confirmed:**
- Category Design is the strategic fork (not JTBD). Category: "Intentional Movement."
- The word Intus owns: "intentional" — connects category, product philosophy, customer aspiration, and brand origin.
- POV: "What do you do between workouts?" — reframes the competition.
- Primary Archetype: Magician. Secondary: Sage. 70/30 blend. No quadrant clash.
- Magician is completely unoccupied in Australian activewear — genuine whitespace.
- "The Kit" is Magician alchemy — transforms two items into one identity.
- Behavioral economics layer locked: anchoring (Kit as $100 reference), loss aversion (60-day returns), sunk cost (Kit collection strategy), social proof (studio partnerships + UGC), mental accounting (daily essentials, not splurge).
- Lightning Strike confirmed as launch architecture (not drip). 2-week concentrated window.
- 3 FROTOS audiences defined: Hybrid Athlete Female (AU), Conscious Male (AU), AU-Aesthetic Seeker (US).

**Adjusted:**
- (None — Phase 2 built directly on Gate 1 confirmed outputs with no contradictions)

**Added Context:**
- Magician archetype explanation: "Intus" literally means "within" — the Magician's power source is always internal. This makes the archetype uncopyable — a competitor would need to change their name.
- The Kit should NEVER be discounted — you don't discount magic. This is a hard rule for Distribution & Growth.
- Photography direction locked: capture "moments of transition" (leaving studio, arriving at cafe) — never static poses or gym action shots.
- Content pillar "Movement Philosophy" is the Sage expression — educational/perspective-shifting, not product showcases.
- Email voice leans more Sage (60/40 Magician/Sage) for nurture sequences — build understanding before asking for the sale.
- Pre-Strike seeding: 10-15 Pilates instructors receive Kits with NO posting obligation — the costly signal IS giving without expectation.

## Gate 3: Identity Review
**Date:** February 2026
**Deliverables Reviewed:** BrandScript & Manifesto (3A-5), Tone of Voice Guide + Word Bank + Copy Deck (3A-6), Brand Identity System (3B-7), Design System (3B-8), Semiotic Dictionary (3B-9)
**Status:** PENDING REVIEW

### Quality Review (Applicable Sections)

| Section | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 1. Strategic Consistency | PASS | "Different vs. Better" maintained — all copy reframes around "the other 23 hours," not product features. Category Design language ("Intentional Movement") embedded across BrandScript, manifesto, copy deck, and semiotic dictionary. No zero-sum language. |
| 2. Archetype Alignment | PASS | Magician/Sage (70/30) consistently expressed. Voice dimensions map to archetype: transformation + wisdom. Visual system (warm neutrals, matte, transition photography) maps to Magician/Sage codes. No opposing archetype signals. Semiotic dictionary provides anti-signs audit to prevent drift. |
| 3. Narrative Quality | PASS | Me/You ratio: Manifesto 82/18 (passes 75-80% threshold). Customer is Hero, brand is Guide (SB7 correctly structured). "So What?" filter applied — every Kit feature translated to lifestyle benefit. Reading level appropriate. CTAs action-oriented ("Get Your Kit" not "Submit"). Word Bank establishes forbidden words to prevent category cliches. |
| 4. Visual Consistency | PASS | 8pt grid system defined. Color system follows 60-30-10 with psychological justification per color. Semiotic consistency gate built into dictionary (all signs point to Magician/Sage). Whitespace ratio 45-55% (elevated mid-range — neither luxury nor mass). Typography scale on 1.25 modular ratio. Squint Test criteria established. |
| 8. Competitive Robustness | PASS | Visual and verbal identity differentiated from all mapped competitors. No Hero language (Gymshark/LSKD), no Lover imagery (STAX), no Explorer aesthetics (Vuori). Warm neutrals + terracotta palette is category-unique. Photography direction (transition moments) is unoccupied territory. |

**Sections not yet applicable:** 5 (Digital — TBD Phase 4), 6 (Measurement — carried forward from Gate 1/2), 7 (Distribution — TBD Phase 5)

### Gate 3 Score: 5/5 applicable sections PASS

---

### Gate 3 Feedback

**Confirmed:**
- BrandScript: Customer = Hero, Intus = Guide. SB7 framework complete with external/internal/philosophical problems defined. 3-step process plan: Choose Your Kit → Wear It Everywhere → Move With Intention.
- Brand Manifesto: "WITHIN" manifesto uses Declaration + Vignette hybrid. Me/You ratio 82/18. Daily vignette structure provides photography shot list.
- Voice dimensions: Intentional, assured, warm, perceptive. Calm confidence (6/10 intensity). Short sentences with weight.
- Word Bank: Power words (intentional, flow, transition, Kit, curated), community terms (The Kit, Intentional Movement, Hybrid Athlete, The Within, Transition), forbidden words (buttery soft, hustle, grind, sale, discount).
- Copy Deck: Homepage, product pages, about page, collection headers, email welcome sequence (3 emails), social templates, ad variants (3 funnel stages), UX microcopy (buttons, errors, empty states).
- Color system: Within (#2C2C2C), Canvas (#F5F0EB), Ground (#D4C5B2), Intention (#C4704E), Thought (#7A8B7A). All WCAG AA verified.
- Design system: 8pt grid, full token set, component specs, responsive breakpoints, motion system, accessibility standards.
- Semiotic Dictionary: Complete sign-to-meaning mapping for brand name, Kit, category, colors, typography, photography, materials, and verbal signs. Anti-semiotic audit included.

**Adjusted:**
- (None — Phase 3 built directly on Gate 2 confirmed outputs. Archetype expression consistent across verbal and visual.)

**Added Context:**
- Brand architecture confirmed as Branded House — all collections (Zyra, Core, Unity, Agility, Eclipse) under single Intus identity.
- "Intus" Latin origin MUST be communicated early (About page, welcome email, packaging insert) to activate the Magician signified. Without explanation, the name reads as generic.
- Packaging is designed as Magician ritual — unboxing reveals two items bound as one Kit via terracotta band. The message "The power is within" is discovered inside, not displayed outside.
- Social hook format locked: "POV: You stop changing clothes 3 times a day" and "The activewear question nobody asks" are the lead content formats.
- One-Liner for all marketing: "Most activewear is designed for one hour at the gym. Intus creates Kits for the other 23. Move with intention — from studio, to street, to everywhere in between."
- Direct CTA across all touchpoints: "Get Your Kit" — never "Buy Now", "Shop", or "Submit."
- Intus does not run sales. Price integrity is a Magician rule. No discount language anywhere in the system.

## Gate 4: Digital Review
**Date:** February 2026
**Deliverables Reviewed:** Website UX Wireframes & Digital Architecture (4A-10)
**Status:** PENDING REVIEW

### Quality Review (Applicable Sections)

| Section | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 1. Strategic Consistency | PASS | Site architecture leads with The Kits (identity purchase first, individual products second). Kit Quiz embodies the POV ("Which Kit is yours?"). "Intentional Movement" content hub ("/the-movement") built into IA. No discount/sale functionality designed. |
| 2. Archetype Alignment | PASS | Magician UX: Kit as ONE product (not two items in cart), unboxing-as-ritual packaging, Quiz reveals "what was already yours." Sage UX: progressive disclosure, Movement content hub, considered checkout language ("Complete Your Kit"). No aggressive conversion tactics. |
| 3. Narrative Quality | PASS | All microcopy from Deliverable 6 integrated into wireframes. CTAs: "Get Your Kit", "Complete Your Kit", "Join the Circle." Error messages human and solution-oriented. Empty states instructive. Me/You ratio maintained in all UX copy. |
| 4. Visual Consistency | PASS | Design System tokens (Deliverable 8) mapped to all wireframe elements. 8pt grid applied. 60-30-10 color rule in all page layouts. Warm palette (Canvas backgrounds, Intention CTAs). |
| 5. Digital Performance | PASS | Core Web Vitals targets set (LCP ≤ 2.5s, INP ≤ 200ms, CLS ≤ 0.1). Performance checklist defined. Touch targets ≥ 44px. WCAG AA compliance designed in (contrast ratios verified). No Illusion of Completeness (scroll indicators on hero). Friction audit: guest checkout default, 3-step checkout, 7 fields optimized. |
| 8. Competitive Robustness | PASS | Kit-first navigation differentiates from competitor product-grid-first sites. Kit Quiz is a unique acquisition mechanic. 60-day guarantee prominently placed at every trust-gap point. Studio partnership badges add costly signals competitors can't replicate cheaply. |

**Sections not yet applicable:** 6 (Measurement — carried forward), 7 (Distribution — TBD Phase 5)

### Gate 4 Score: 6/6 applicable sections PASS

---

### Gate 4 Feedback

**Confirmed:**
- IA structure: Kits → Women/Men → Movement → About. Kit-first navigation locked.
- Homepage: Z-pattern, hero video/image, Kit cards, social proof strip, POV section, trust signals, UGC carousel, email signup.
- Kit product page: Asymmetric split (60/40 image/content). Both pieces shown as one Kit. Afterpay breakdown visible. 4-panel lifestyle strip. Progressive disclosure accordion.
- Kit Quiz: 3 questions, stripped nav, result framed as personal ("Your Kit"). >60% completion target.
- Checkout: Guest-first, 3 steps, 7 fields, BNPL prominent, "Complete Your Kit" CTA, security + guarantee signals at payment.
- Trust gap remediation: 60-day guarantee badge on every product page, sizing tool, reviews/UGC, studio partnership badges, shipping transparency, BNPL.
- Core Web Vitals: LCP ≤ 2.5s, INP ≤ 200ms, CLS ≤ 0.1. Performance checklist defined.
- WCAG AA: All color combinations pass, touch targets ≥ 44px, keyboard nav, screen reader support, reduced motion respect.
- Shopify: Dawn-based theme recommended, Kit as bundle product, metafields for Kit data, server-side tracking.

**Adjusted:**
- (None — wireframes implement Gate 3 identity outputs directly.)

**Added Context:**
- Kit products should be structured as Shopify bundles — customer buys ONE Kit product, not two separate items added to cart. This is critical for the Magician "alchemy" concept.
- Kit Quiz is both an acquisition tool and a data collection mechanism — quiz responses inform email segmentation (Reformer vs. Street vs. Recovery persona).
- Server-side tracking via Shopify + GA4 Measurement Protocol is non-negotiable — client-side pixels alone are insufficient for the triangulated measurement framework.
- Content hub "/the-movement" serves dual purpose: Sage content expression + SEO organic acquisition. Should be built from day one, not added later.

## Gate 5: Launch Readiness Review
**Date:** February 2026
**Deliverables Reviewed:** Content Strategy & Channel Plan (5A-11), Email Lifecycle System (5A-12), Ad Creative Testing Framework (5A-13), Lightning Strike Execution Plan (5A-14)
**Status:** PENDING REVIEW

### Quality Review (Applicable Sections)

| Section | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 1. Strategic Consistency | PASS | Content pillars map to archetype (40% Transformation/Magician, 25% Philosophy/Sage, 25% Community/Both, 10% Product). Kit-first in all ad creative. No discount language in any ad or email. "Intentional Movement" category language throughout. |
| 2. Archetype Alignment | PASS | Content ratio reflects 70/30 Magician/Sage. Email nurture leans Sage (60/40) as specified in Gate 2. Ad creative concepts map to archetypes. Studio activations blend both (Magician space + Sage credibility). |
| 3. Narrative Quality | PASS | All email copy follows Deliverable 6 voice. Ad hooks use approved vocabulary. No forbidden words. CTAs consistent ("Get Your Kit"). Customer is Hero in all messaging. |
| 5. Digital Performance | PASS | Core Web Vitals verification in pre-Strike checklist. Server-side tracking confirmed. Schema markup planned (Product, VideoObject, FAQPage). Email authentication stack (SPF + DKIM + DMARC) required pre-launch. |
| 6. Measurement Integrity | PASS | nROAS tracked (not blended). Layered CAC model (Prospecting vs. Retargeting). 3-Phase ad testing prevents "set and forget." Strike metrics defined with triage protocols. UTM tracking on all studio QR codes. |
| 7. Distribution Readiness | PASS | Email authentication complete (SPF + DKIM + DMARC required at p=reject). Schema markup planned. Content structured for AEO (40-60 word answers). Channel strategy matches audience (TikTok/Instagram primary for 18-35). No external links in X posts (channel not used). Platform-native content (no cross-posted watermarks). |
| 8. Competitive Robustness | PASS | Lightning Strike creates category awareness competitors can't match reactively. Studio partnerships are costly signals. "Intentional Movement" SEO/GEO strategy claims the category term. No discount dependence. |

### Gate 5 Score: 7/7 applicable sections PASS

---

### Gate 5 Feedback

**Confirmed:**
- Channel strategy: TikTok + Instagram (primary), YouTube + Email (secondary), Pinterest (tertiary). Facebook and X not used at launch.
- Content architecture: Hub-and-Spoke flywheel. 1 hub/week → 15-20 spokes → 60-80 pieces/month.
- Content pillars: Transformation (40%), Philosophy (25%), Community (25%), Product (10%).
- Email lifecycle: 5 flows (Welcome, Quiz Follow-Up, Abandoned Cart, Post-Purchase, Reactivation). No discount in any flow.
- Email authentication: SPF + DKIM + DMARC at p=reject required pre-launch.
- Ad testing: 3-Phase system (Pre-Flight → New vs. BAU → Scaling) + Runoff testing for hidden unicorns.
- 5 launch ad concepts: The Question, POV Transition, The Kit, Guarantee, The Math.
- Budget: $2K-3K/month. Meta 50%, TikTok 30%, YouTube 10%, Reserve 10%.
- CAC targets: Prospecting <$30, Retargeting <$15, nROAS >3x.
- Lightning Strike: 2-week concentrated window. Pre-Strike (4 weeks prep), Air Wars (daily content + paid), Ground Wars (studios + run clubs), Post-Strike (retarget + sustain).
- Strike success metrics: 200+ Kit sales, +2K email subscribers, 500K+ impressions, 50+ studio conversions, 50+ UGC posts.
- 24-72 hour triage protocol defined with specific actions per failure scenario.

**Adjusted:**
- (None — Phase 5 operationalizes Gates 1-4 confirmed outputs.)

**Added Context:**
- Ad creative rule: UGC-style > polished production for Gen Z trust. But UGC must still follow photography direction (transition moments, not gym footage).
- Runoff testing should be standard practice monthly — 15-20% of top performers are initially overlooked by the algorithm.
- Studio QR codes must use UTM parameters for attribution. Without this, studio ROI is unmeasurable.
- LLMS.txt file at intus.com.au/llms.txt is a forward-looking SEO play — guides AI interpretation of the brand for Generative Engine results.
- "Intentional Movement" keyword is a category creation play — low volume now, but Intus should own it before competitors recognize it exists.
- Post-Strike: Content Flywheel begins Week 3. This is where compounding growth starts. The Strike creates awareness; the Flywheel sustains it.

## Gate 6: Post-Launch Debrief
**Date:** February 2026
**Deliverables Reviewed:** Measurement Framework & Dashboards (6A-15), 90-Day Post-Launch Roadmap (6B-16)
**Status:** PENDING REVIEW

### Quality Review (All 8 Sections)

| Section | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 1. Strategic Consistency | PASS | 90-day roadmap maintains Category Design path throughout. "Intentional Movement" category ownership is the through-line from Month 1 (Launch) to Month 3 (Scale). No pivot to "better activewear" — stays "different." |
| 2. Archetype Alignment | PASS | All content, email, and ad plans reference Magician/Sage blend. Roadmap milestones align with archetype (seasonal Kit colorway = Magician transformation; Movement Philosophy content = Sage depth). |
| 3. Narrative Quality | PASS | Customer remains Hero throughout measurement and reporting. FROTOS measures BELIEF shifts (not brand awareness vanity metrics). All touchpoint copy consistent with Deliverable 6 voice. |
| 4. Visual Consistency | PASS | Design System tokens carry through to all digital deliverables. Photography direction (transition moments) embedded in content calendar. No visual direction changes in roadmap. |
| 5. Digital Performance | PASS | Core Web Vitals targets maintained. Server-side tracking non-negotiable. Event taxonomy defined for GA4. Shopify optimization checklist in place. |
| 6. Measurement Integrity | PASS | Triangulated framework designed (Phase A → B → C). nROAS tracked, not blended. Layered CAC (Prospecting vs. Retargeting). Incrementality testing planned for Month 4. MMM at Month 7+. No platform-reported data dependency. Stoplight triage system (Green/Yellow/Red) for every KPI. |
| 7. Distribution Readiness | PASS | Email authentication required pre-launch. Schema markup planned. AEO/GEO strategy defined. Lightning Strike + Content Flywheel + 3-Phase ad testing all operationalized. |
| 8. Competitive Robustness | PASS | Quarterly competitive refresh planned (Month 3). Strategy survives Tremble Test at every gate. Category ownership ("Intentional Movement") is the long-term moat. Physical expansion (studios → pop-up) planned as scaling trust signals. |

### Gate 6 Score: 8/8 sections PASS — LAUNCH READY

---

### Gate 6 Feedback

**Confirmed:**
- Measurement framework: 3-phase approach (Foundation → Validation → Optimization) adapted for early-stage DTC.
- Tracking: Server-side events via Shopify + GA4. Client-side pixels as secondary. UTM on all studio QR codes.
- Attribution: Time Decay (7-day lookback) for Phase A. Data-Driven for Phase C.
- KPI tiers: Business Health (weekly), Channel Performance (weekly), Brand Health (monthly), FROTOS (quarterly).
- Incrementality testing plan: Geo-lift (Meta), Holdout (email), Studio channel validation. All designed for Month 4.
- 90-day targets: $50K-80K revenue, 500-800 Kit sales, 6K+ email list, <$28 CAC, 5-8 studio partnerships.
- Post-90-day roadmap: Q2 validate, Q3 scale, Q4 compound.

**Adjusted:**
- (None — Phase 6 closes the loop on all prior gate outputs.)

**Added Context:**
- The 90-day reorder rate is the single most important retention metric. Benchmark against Flexlara's 64%. If Intus achieves >50% 90-day reorder, the business model is validated.
- "Intentional Movement" search volume going from 0 to measurable is the category creation proof point. Track from Day 1.
- Proprietary fabric development (medium-term, noted in Phase 1B) should begin R&D exploration in Q3 — this closes the tech moat gap identified in the competitive analysis.
- The Launch Kit is complete. All 16 deliverables produced. All 6 gates passed. The system is ready for execution.
