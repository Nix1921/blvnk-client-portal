## 2. Market Sizing & Segmentation

### 2.1 Total Addressable Market

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Australian activewear market (2025) | USD $8.7 billion | Industry report |
| Projected market (2034) | USD $13.2 billion | CAGR 4.63% |
| Fitness & athletic clothing stores (2024) | AUD $4.2 billion | Market analysis |
| GDP contribution (2024) | AUD $1.52 billion | Economic data |

### 2.2 Category Breakdown

| Segment | Share | Revenue |
|---------|-------|---------|

### 2.3 Intus Serviceable Market

Intus operates in Sports Apparel only (no footwear). Within that $2.3B segment:
- **Mid-range DTC activewear** (price point $45-$115 AUD): Estimated 25-30% of apparel segment = ~$575M-$690M
- **Target demo (18-35, dual gender, metro AU)**: Further narrows to ~$200M-$250M serviceable addressable market
- **Realistic early-stage capture**: At <$100K revenue, Intus holds <0.05% of serviceable market

### 2.4 Growth Drivers

1. **Athleisure fusion** — sport and fashion convergence continuing post-pandemic
2. **Men's activewear growth** — segment expanding faster than women's, less saturated
3. **Pilates surge** — #2 fitness trend nationally (AUSactive 2025-26), aligns with Intus's "Hybrid Athlete"
4. **Exercise for mental health** — #3 trend, resonates with "inner power" brand philosophy
5. **BNPL adoption** — 18-35 demographic heavily uses Afterpay/Klarna for fashion purchases

## 3. Competitive Gap Analysis

### 3.1 Assess — Rival Identification

**Tier 1: Direct Domestic Rivals**

| Brand | Revenue/Scale | Positioning | Price Tier | Moat |
|-------|--------------|-------------|------------|------|
| **LSKD** | High growth, major athlete program | Sport x Street, "1% Better" | Mid-High ($80 leggings) | Community + action-sport aesthetic |
| **Echt** | High volume, discount-driven | Athletic aesthetic, frequent drops | Mid ($75-95, aggressive bundles) | Variety + promotional mechanics |
| **STAX** | Premium, viral marketing | Fashion-forward, inclusive | Premium | "Airlyte" proprietary fabric, XXS-4XL |
| **Lorna Jane** | $166M revenue (2024), ~100 stores | Legacy leader, "Active Living" | Premium ($99.99 leggings) | Physical retail + LJ Excel™ fabric |
| **Elite Eleven** | 82% YoY growth, 240% POS growth | Sport & Lifestyle hybrid | Accessible/Mid | Omnichannel (physical + digital) |

**Tier 2: Global Benchmarks**

| Brand | Positioning | Price Tier | Moat |
|-------|-------------|------------|------|
| **Gymshark** | Global gym culture, "United We Sweat" | Mid ($60 USD leggings) | Massive community, lifting-specific |
| **Vuori** | Coastal California lifestyle | Premium ($118 USD joggers) | DreamKnit™, BlissBlend™ |
| **Alo Yoga** | Studio-to-street luxury wellness | Luxury | Celebrity + lifestyle expansion |

**Tier 3: Niche / Emerging Disruptors**

| Brand | Threat | Why It Matters |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Flexlara** | High | Undercuts on price ($39 leggings), beats on transparency (19c cost-per-wear), 64% reorder rate |
| **Nimble** | Medium | MoveLite recycled fabric, Bondi cred, sustainability-first |
| **Shein/Temu** | Volume threat | Ultra-cheap imports, low trust but high volume capture |

### 3.2 Benchmark — Deep Comparison (Top 5 Direct)

| Dimension | Intus | LSKD | Echt | STAX | Lorna Jane |
|-----------|-------|------|------|------|------------|
| **Avg legging price** | $70 | $80 | $75 (bundle: 2/$130) | Premium | $99.99 |
| **Bundling** | Look bundles ($100 sets) | Volume (2-for deals) | Volume (3-for/$120) | Minimal | Spend-and-save ($200+) |
| **Proprietary fabric** | None | None specific | None specific | Airlyte™ | LJ Excel™ |
| **Physical retail** | None (DTC only) | Expanding | Limited | Limited | ~100 stores |
| **Sustainability** | "Eco Friendly" filter | Limited | Limited | Limited | Limited |
| **Men's range** | Yes (growing) | Yes (strong) | Yes | Yes | No |
| **US shipping** | Yes (>$200 free) | Yes | Yes | **No** | Yes |
| **BNPL** | 4 providers | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Community mechanic** | #itsallyou UGC | "Chase the Vibe" | Drops/sales | Viral/influencer | "Move Nourish Believe" |

### 3.3 Strategize — Gap Identification

**Product Gap:** No proprietary fabric technology. Every mid-to-premium competitor has branded fabric or is developing one. Intus's "buttery, soft comfort" is indistinguishable from fast fashion copy.

**Service Gap:** 30-day return policy vs. Flexlara's 30-day change-of-mind even after washing. Consumer research shows 92% peace-of-mind at 60-day return policies.

**Positioning Gap:** Currently "Better" (softer, cheaper Vuori) but not "Different." No category ownership. No unique vocabulary. The "Within" brand meaning is powerful but invisible in marketing.

**Distribution Gap:** DTC-only in a market moving to omnichannel. Elite Eleven proved physical retail lifts online revenue by 50%. Intus has zero physical touchpoints.

**Efficiency Gap:** Bundling strategy is different (look bundles vs. volume bundles) but isn't positioned as a distinct identity — it's just a discount mechanic.

## 4. Porter's Five Forces

### Threat of New Entry: HIGH

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Capital requirements | Low — Shopify + dropship/print-on-demand accessible |
| Brand loyalty barriers | Medium — established community brands (LSKD, Gymshark) have loyalty |
| Distribution access | Low barrier — DTC removes gatekeepers |
| Economies of scale | Advantage to large players (container costs $3K→$14K favor scale) |
| Regulatory/IP barriers | Low — no patents on most activewear designs |

**Implication:** Easy to enter, hard to sustain. Hundreds of micro-brands launch annually. Differentiation is the only survival mechanism.

### Buyer Power: HIGH

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Switching costs | Near-zero — no lock-in for activewear |
| Price sensitivity | High — BNPL adoption, price-tier navigation, bundle mechanics all indicate price-conscious buyers |
| Information availability | High — reviews, UGC, comparison content abundant |
| Alternative options | Abundant — 20+ AU brands plus global players |

**Implication:** Buyers have total power. Must create emotional switching costs (community, identity) since product switching costs are zero.

### Supplier Power: MODERATE

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Fabric suppliers | Concentrated — limited premium textile manufacturers |
| Manufacturing | Moderate — most AU brands use Asian manufacturing |
| Proprietary materials | Increasing — brands developing exclusive fabrics raise supplier dependency |
| Container shipping costs | Rising — $3K to $14K, favoring established relationships |

**Implication:** No immediate supplier crisis, but brands without proprietary fabric partnerships are at the mercy of commodity pricing.

### Threat of Substitutes: MODERATE-HIGH

| Substitute | Threat Level |
|------------|-------------|
| Fast fashion activewear (Shein, Temu, Cotton On Body) | High volume, low trust |
| Luxury athleisure (Alo Yoga, Lululemon) | Trade-up risk for aspirational buyers |
| Non-branded workout clothing | Commodity threat |
| Vintage/secondhand activewear | Growing sustainability trend |

**Implication:** The mid-range is a squeeze zone — pressure from below (ultra-cheap) and above (premium lifestyle). Must escape the middle through identity, not price.

### Competitive Rivalry: VERY HIGH

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| Number of competitors | 20+ documented brands in AU market alone |
| Market growth | 4.63% CAGR — growing but not explosive |
| Product differentiation | Low to moderate — most compete on fabric feel + aesthetic |
| Exit barriers | Low for digital-only brands |
| Strategic stakes | High — athleisure is a lifestyle category, not just apparel |

**Implication:** Crowded, rivalrous market. Current competition is predominantly a Red Ocean — brands fighting over the same "soft, stylish, affordable" positioning.

### Five Forces Summary

| Force | Rating | Strategic Response |
|-------|--------|--------------------|
| New Entry Threat | HIGH | Build community moat, brand identity as barrier |
| Buyer Power | HIGH | Create emotional switching costs via identity + community |
| Supplier Power | MODERATE | Develop proprietary fabric partnership long-term |
| Substitute Threat | MOD-HIGH | Escape the mid-range squeeze through category design |
| Competitive Rivalry | VERY HIGH | Stop competing on "Better" — need "Different" |

## 5. Perceptual Mapping + Whitespace

### Axis: Price (Low → High) vs. Identity (Performance → Lifestyle)

```
                    LIFESTYLE
                       |
            Vuori ●    |    ● Alo Yoga
                       |
         Intus ○       |       ● P.E Nation
                       |
    Echt ●    LSKD ●   |   ● STAX
                       |
         Flexlara ●    |       ● Lorna Jane
                       |
                    PERFORMANCE
         ──────────────┼──────────────
              LOW      |      HIGH
                     PRICE
```

### Whitespace Identified

1. **"Intentional Movement" territory** — Between lifestyle and performance, at mid-price. No brand owns the intersection of mindful training + everyday wear with a philosophical foundation. Intus's "Within" positioning could claim this space.

2. **Men's lifestyle activewear at mid-price** — Gymshark owns "gym-bro," Vuori owns "premium coastal." The Melbourne-based, minimal, everyday male athleisure shopper is underserved.

3. **Transparency + mid-price** — Flexlara owns transparency at budget. No mid-price brand has made supply-chain transparency a core identity element.

## 6. Brand Health Baseline

### Current State (Pre-Launch Measurement)

| Metric | Current Estimate | Target (Post-Launch) | Method |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|--------|
| **BAI (Brand Awareness Index)** | ~2-5% (niche awareness in Melbourne fitness community) | 15-20% in target demo | Survey: unaided + aided recall |
| **SOV (Share of Voice)** | <1% of category conversation | 3-5% in target demo | Social listening + Share of Search |
| **NSS (Net Sentiment Score)** | Insufficient data (low volume) | >60 | NLP sentiment analysis |
| **NPS (Net Promoter Score)** | Not yet measurable | >40 | Post-purchase survey |
| **Share of Search** | Negligible | 2-3% of category searches | Google Trends + SEMrush |

**Note:** Intus is pre-scale. These baselines serve as the "zero point" against which all launch kit activities will be measured.

---

## 7. Customer Journey Mapping

### The Hybrid Athlete Journey

**Stage 1: Awareness**
- **Touchpoints:** TikTok/Instagram discovery (video-first), UGC via #itsallyou, word-of-mouth in fitness communities
- **Barrier:** Low brand awareness. Competing against algorithm-favored established brands.
- **Current gap:** No paid media strategy. Organic only.

**Stage 2: Interest**
- **Touchpoints:** Website visit, product browsing, price-tier navigation (Under $40/$60)
- **Barrier:** Generic product descriptions don't differentiate from fast fashion screenshots
- **Current gap:** "Buttery, soft comfort" = same language as every competitor

**Stage 3: Consideration**
- **Touchpoints:** Bundle comparison, BNPL calculation, sizing/fit evaluation
- **Barrier:** No physical retail to touch/feel. 30-day return policy lags market (should be 60+)
- **Current gap:** Trust gap — digital-only brand with no reviews ecosystem at scale

**Stage 4: Conversion**
- **Touchpoints:** Cart, checkout, BNPL selection, free shipping threshold ($150)
- **Barrier:** $150 free shipping threshold may be too high for first-time buyers
- **Current gap:** No first-purchase incentive beyond bundles

**Stage 5: Retention**
- **Touchpoints:** Email/SMS lifecycle, reorder prompts, community engagement
- **Barrier:** No loyalty program, no proprietary product experience that creates dependency
- **Current gap:** Email/SMS exists but no documented lifecycle system

**Stage 6: Advocacy**
- **Touchpoints:** #itsallyou UGC, referral, reviews
- **Barrier:** Small community = low UGC volume
- **Current gap:** Hashtag exists but not amplified into a systematic advocacy engine

## 8. Measurement Framework Design (Triangulated)

### For an Early-Stage DTC Brand

Given Intus's stage (pre-scale, <$100K, digital-only), the full MMM/MTA/Incrementality framework needs to be adapted:

### Phase 1: Foundation Metrics (Now → Month 3)

| Layer | Metric | Tool | Why |
|-------|--------|------|-----|
| **Acquisition** | CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) | Shopify + UTM tracking | Know what each customer costs |
| **Acquisition** | nROAS (New Customer ROAS) | First-party attribution | Separate new vs. returning revenue |
| **Revenue** | AOV (Average Order Value) | Shopify analytics | Track bundle effectiveness |
| **Revenue** | MER (Marketing Efficiency Ratio) | Total Revenue / Total Ad Spend | Holistic efficiency view |
| **Retention** | Repeat Purchase Rate | Shopify + Klaviyo | Baseline loyalty |
| **Retention** | 90-Day Reorder Rate | Cohort analysis | Compare against Flexlara's 64% benchmark |
| **Brand** | Share of Search | Google Trends + SEMrush | Track branded search growth |
| **Brand** | Social SOV | Social listening tool | Track conversation share |

### Phase 2: Attribution Layer (Month 3 → Month 6)

| Method | Application | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **First-party tracking** | Server-side events via Shopify + CAPI | Engineering setup |
| **UTM discipline** | Standardized, lowercase UTM taxonomy | Marketing ops |
| **Lookback windows** | 60-day minimum for activewear consideration cycle | Platform configuration |
| **C+DV for video** | Clicks + Deterministic Views for TikTok/YouTube | Video-first channel strategy |

### Phase 3: Triangulation (Month 6+, when data matures)

| Method | Purpose | Data Requirement |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **Simplified MMM** | Channel-level budget allocation | 6+ months of spend + revenue data |
| **MTA (Time Decay)** | Short sales cycle attribution | User-level tracking |
| **Geo-lift testing** | Causal validation of ad spend | Sufficient volume for geo splits |

### KPI Targets (First 90 Days Post-Launch)

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| CAC | <$45 AUD | Must be <50% of AOV to be sustainable |
| AOV | >$95 AUD | Bundle strategy should push above single-item average |
| MER | >3.0x | Early-stage benchmark (5.0x is mature brand target) |
| Repeat Purchase Rate | >15% within 90 days | Baseline for retention health |
| Share of Search | >0.5% of category | Measurable awareness signal |
| Email List | >2,000 subscribers | Foundation for lifecycle marketing |
| NPS | >30 (first cohort) | Minimum viable loyalty signal |

### Red Flags to Monitor

- Blended ROAS used for scaling decisions (must track nROAS separately)
- Platform-reported conversions without server-side verification
- High CAC with low repeat rate = leaky bucket
- Bundle discounts eroding margin without increasing LTV

---

## 9. Key Findings & Strategic Implications

### The Three Truths

1. **The market is growing but crowded.** $8.7B → $13.2B growth is real, but 20+ brands are fighting for the same "soft, stylish, affordable" positioning. Growth alone won't save an undifferentiated brand.

2. **Mid-range is a squeeze zone.** Pressure from ultra-cheap (Shein/Temu) and premium aspirational (Vuori/Alo). Brands that stay in the "better version of the same thing" middle get compressed.

3. **Identity is the only moat.** At Intus's stage, they can't out-spend (Lorna Jane), out-distribute (Elite Eleven), or out-tech (STAX/Vuori). The "Within" philosophy is the only asset that can't be copied — but it's currently invisible.

### Recommendations for Downstream Departments

| Department | Key Input from Intelligence |
|------------|----------------------------|
| **Competitive Dynamics** | Market is Red Ocean. Pricing dynamics follow Prisoner's Dilemma (bundle wars). Need game-changing move, not incremental competition. STAX doesn't ship to US — exploit this gap. |
| **Strategy & Psychology** | "Different vs. Better" audit is critical. Current positioning = "Better" (softer, cheaper Vuori). Must find "Different" through category design or JTBD reframe. |
| **Narrative & Verbal Identity** | Current vocabulary is generic category clichés. "Within" brand story is the #1 untapped asset. Customer language needs complete overhaul. |
| **Creative & Visual** | Perceptual map shows whitespace in "Intentional Movement" territory. Visual identity should reflect philosophical depth, not just "clean minimal activewear." |
| **Digital & Systems** | Shopify DTC is the entire brand experience. Trust gap means website must overcompensate — reviews, sizing tools, return policy upgrade (30→60 days). |
| **Distribution & Growth** | Video-first channels active but strategy unclear. Email lifecycle critical for retention given zero physical touchpoints. Pop-up strategy could close trust gap. |
