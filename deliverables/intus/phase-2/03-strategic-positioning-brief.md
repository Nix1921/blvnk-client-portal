# Strategic Positioning Brief & Category Blueprint — Intus
**Department:** Strategy & Psychology Lab
**Phase:** 2A | Launch Kit
**Date:** February 2026

---

## 1. "Different vs. Better" Audit

### Current State: Competing on "Better"

Intus currently operates within the existing activewear frame — "soft, stylish, affordable" — and attempts to be a *better* version of what already exists. This is a losing position.

| Dimension | Intus (Current) | Competitor Default | Verdict |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| Fabric | "Buttery, soft comfort" | "DreamKnit", "Airlyte", "Peach Perfect" | **Same frame** — Intus uses generic descriptors while competitors own proprietary names |
| Pricing | Bundle & Save ($100 sets) | 2-for deals, volume bundles, constant sales | **Same frame** — both use discount mechanics to drive AOV |
| Aesthetic | "Clean, elevated essentials" | "Minimal", "premium", "elevated" | **Same frame** — every mid-range brand claims this |
| Community | #itsallyou | "1% Better Every Day" (LSKD), "Active Living" (Lorna Jane) | **Same frame** — hashtag without costly signal |
| Sustainability | "Eco Friendly" filter on site | Recycled polyester, B Corp, carbon neutral | **Same frame** — sustainability as footnote, not headline |

### Required Shift: From "Better" to "Different"

The Phase 1 competitive analysis confirmed: Intus cannot out-spend, out-distribute, or out-tech its competitors. The only viable path is to **reframe what the competition is about**.

**The reframe:** Stop competing on *what activewear is made of* and start competing on *what movement means*.

| "Better" (Current Frame) | "Different" (New Frame) |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| "Our fabric is softer" | "We believe movement has meaning" |
| "Our bundles save you money" | "The Kit is your daily uniform for intentional living" |
| "We're like Gymshark but cleaner" | "We're the brand for people who move with purpose" |
| "Activewear for the gym" | "Essentials for the Hybrid Athlete's entire day" |

**Verdict: DIFFERENT path confirmed. Category Design is the strategic fork.**

---

## 2. Strategic Fork: Category Design

### Why Category Design (Not JTBD)

| Criteria | Category Design | JTBD | Intus Fit |
|----------|----------------|------|-----------|
| Market state | Create new space | Serve existing needs better | Intus needs new space — "better activewear" is a Red Ocean |
| Customer language | Doesn't exist yet | Customers can articulate it | Customers don't have words for "intentional movement" yet |
| Competitive response | Hard to follow (category queen advantage) | Easy to copy (feature parity) | Intus needs a position competitors can't copy |
| Brand name alignment | "Intus" = Latin for "within" = perfect category vessel | Name is irrelevant to job | The name IS the category |
| Revenue ceiling | Category queens capture 76% of category economics | Incremental share gains | Intus needs disproportionate capture, not incremental share |

**Decision: Category Design. Intus will design and own the "Intentional Movement" category.**

### The Category: Intentional Movement

**Category Definition:** Intentional Movement is the practice of moving through your entire day — gym, studio, commute, social — with awareness and purpose. It rejects the binary of "workout clothes" vs. "real clothes" and the hustle-culture framing of "no days off." Intentional Movement says: every movement counts, not just the ones that make you sweat.

**Category Name Candidates:**

| Option | Strengths | Weaknesses | Recommendation |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| "Intentional Movement" | Descriptive, philosophical depth, aligns with "Within" | Slightly long, may need shortening for hashtags | **PRIMARY** |
| "Movement Philosophy" | Academic gravitas, content-rich | Could feel pretentious for mid-range brand | Secondary / content pillar name |
| "Everyday Movement" | Accessible, clear | Generic, lacks philosophical weight | Reject |

**The Word Intus Owns:** "Intentional"

Every category queen owns a word. Volvo owns "safety." Patagonia owns "environment." **Intus owns "intentional."** This word connects:
- "Intentional Movement" (the category)
- "Intentional design" (the product philosophy)
- "Intentional living" (the customer aspiration)
- "Intus" / "Within" (the brand origin — intention starts within)

## 3. Category Blueprint

### The Ecosystem Map

```
                    INTENTIONAL MOVEMENT
                           |
            +--------------+--------------+
            |              |              |
        THE PRACTICE   THE PRODUCT    THE COMMUNITY
            |              |              |
    +-------+-------+  +--+--+    +------+------+
    |       |       |  |     |    |      |      |
  Studio  Street  Rest Kit  Layers  Studios  Clubs  Digital
  Movement Movement     Singles       Partners  Content
```

**THE PRACTICE** — What Intentional Movement looks like:
- **Studio Movement:** Reformer Pilates, yoga, functional training (high-awareness exercise)
- **Street Movement:** Walking, running, cycling to/from places (movement as transport, not just exercise)
- **Rest as Movement:** Recovery, stretching, mindful stillness (intentional non-movement)

**THE PRODUCT** — What Intus makes for Intentional Movers:
- **The Kit:** Curated daily uniform (top + bottom as identity set, not discount bundle)
- **Layers:** Outerwear and transition pieces for between-movement states
- **Singles:** Individual pieces that integrate into The Kit ecosystem

**THE COMMUNITY** — Where Intentional Movers gather:
- **Studio Partners:** Reformer Pilates studios (priority coalition from Phase 1B)
- **Movement Clubs:** Melbourne run clubs, walking groups, outdoor fitness
- **Digital Content:** Movement philosophy content (education, not product showcases)

### Category Potential (CP)

**CP = People with the problem x Price willing to pay**

- Addressable population: The "Hybrid Athlete" segment in Australia = ~2.4M consumers (18-35, metro, fitness-active, dual gender)
- Problem prevalence: ~60% feel their activewear doesn't represent their full lifestyle (gym-only framing)
- Price willingness: Mid-range sweet spot ($45-$115 AUD per item, $100-$200 per Kit)
- **CP = 1.44M x $150 avg Kit = ~$216M addressable category value**

This aligns with the Phase 1A serviceable market estimate of $200-250M.

## 4. Positioning Architecture

### The Positioning Statement

**For** the Hybrid Athlete who moves between studio, street, and social life,
**Intus** is the **Intentional Movement brand** that
**provides** curated daily uniforms ("The Kit") designed for how you actually live,
**unlike** traditional activewear brands that optimize for the gym and treat everything else as an afterthought,
**because** Intus believes every movement has meaning — and what you wear should reflect that intention.

### The POV (Point of View)

Every activewear brand asks: "What do you do when you work out?"

Intus asks: **"What do you do between workouts?"**

That question changes everything. Because the Hybrid Athlete doesn't segment their day into "gym time" and "real life." They move through reformer class, coffee with friends, a walking meeting, grocery shopping, and evening stretching — all as one continuous flow. Their clothes should work the same way.

Traditional activewear is designed for the 60-minute window. Intus is designed for the other 23 hours.

### Problem → Solution → Outcome

| Layer | Traditional Frame | Intus Frame |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| **Problem** | "I need clothes for the gym" | "I need clothes that move with me all day" |
| **Solution** | Performance fabrics, gym-optimized fit | Curated Kits for the full-day Hybrid Athlete |
| **Outcome** | "I look good at the gym" | "I move through my day with intention and confidence" |

---

## 5. Behavioral Economics Execution Layer

### 5.1 Anchoring Strategy

**The Kit as Anchor:** Launch "The Kit" at $100 AUD. This becomes the reference price for the Intus ecosystem.
- Individual pieces (Tank $45, Shorts $55 = $100 separately) are priced to make The Kit feel like the natural choice
- This is NOT a discount. The Kit IS the product. Individual pieces are the unbundled version.

**Reframe:** "The Kit for $100" (identity framing) vs. "Tank + Shorts for $100" (discount framing). Same price, different psychology.

### 5.2 Loss Aversion Deployment

**60-Day Return Policy** (recommended in Phase 1B as costly signal):
- Frame: "Try The Kit for 60 days. If it doesn't change how you move, send it back."
- Psychology: Once customers have worn The Kit for 60 days, loss aversion kicks in — returning it means *losing* their daily uniform
- Competitors with 30-day policies can't match this without absorbing higher return costs
- Expected return rate: <8% (Flexlara's 64% 90-day reorder rate suggests high satisfaction in this category)

### 5.3 Sunk Cost & Identity Lock-In

**"The Kit" Collection Strategy:**
- Season 1: Launch with 3 Kit combinations (Reformer Kit, Street Kit, Recovery Kit)
- Season 2: Introduce Kit extensions (add a Layer piece to existing Kit)
- Season 3: Kit evolution (updated colorways that complement previous Kits)
- Psychology: Each Kit purchase increases identity investment. Customers who own 2+ Kits are buying into the Intentional Movement lifestyle, not just clothes.

### 5.4 Social Proof Architecture

| Signal Type | Mechanism | Deployment |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Community Volume** | "X Kits claimed this week" (real-time counter) | Product pages, checkout |
| **Authority** | Pilates studio partnerships (instructor endorsement) | Studio presence, Instagram co-content |
| **Conformity** | "What's in my Kit" UGC content format | TikTok/Instagram format, #MyIntusKit |
| **Scarcity** | Seasonal Kit colorways (limited, not artificial) | Quarterly drops, genuine limited runs |

### 5.5 Mental Accounting

Position The Kit in the "daily essentials" mental account, not the "activewear splurge" account:
- "$100 for your daily uniform" (like coffee: $5/day x 20 days = $100/month)
- Comparison anchors: "Less than a month of daily coffee" or "Less than one Lorna Jane legging"
- BNPL reinforcement: $25/fortnight via Afterpay = "the cost of two coffees a week"

**Target Belief to Shift:** "The Australian aesthetic I want is available and affordable to ship."

## 7. Lightning Strike Plan

### Strike Architecture: Concentrated 2-Week Launch Window

**Principle:** Intentional Movement is a new category. New categories require Lightning Strikes — concentrated awareness pushes that create the sense of inevitability. Drip marketing cannot build a category.

### Pre-Strike (Weeks -4 to -1): Ground Preparation

| Action | Owner | Timeline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Finalize 3 Kit combinations (Reformer, Street, Recovery) | Product/Creative | Week -4 |
| Secure 3-5 Melbourne Pilates studio partnerships | Distribution | Week -4 to -2 |
| Produce "The Within Story" founder content (origin of Intus name) | Narrative/Creative | Week -3 |
| Build "What's In My Kit" UGC template for seeding | Creative/Distribution | Week -2 |
| Seed 10-15 Pilates instructors with Kits (no posting obligation — costly signal) | Distribution | Week -2 |
| Email list warm-up: "Something is changing" teaser sequence | Distribution | Week -1 |
| 60-day return policy implemented and QA'd on site | Digital | Week -1 |

### Air Wars (Week 1-2): Category Announcement

| Channel | Content | Frequency |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **TikTok** | "The 23-Hour Question" — POV content asking what you wear between workouts | 5-7 posts/week |
| **Instagram** | "The Kit" visual reveals — styled as daily uniform, not gym outfit | 4-5 posts/week + Stories daily |
| **YouTube** | "The Within Story" — 3-5 min founder documentary on why movement has meaning | 1 anchor video + 3 shorts |
| **Email** | "Introducing Intentional Movement" — category manifesto + Kit reveal | 3 emails over 2 weeks |
| **PR** | Pitch to AU fitness/lifestyle media: "Melbourne brand redefines what activewear is for" | 5-10 targeted pitches |

### Ground Wars (Week 1-2): Physical Activation

| Activation | Location | Mechanic |
|------------|----------|----------|
| "The Kit Launch" at partner Pilates studios | 3-5 Melbourne studios | Kit display + QR code for exclusive studio discount. Instructors wear Kits during class. |
| Melbourne run club activation | 1-2 running groups | "The Street Kit" worn by 10 runners. Post-run coffee. Photographer captures the transition (run → cafe). |
| Pop-up "Kit Bar" (if budget allows) | Melbourne athleisure precinct | 48-hour popup where customers build their own Kit from curated options. Not a store — an experience. |

### Post-Strike (Weeks 3-4): Sustain & Convert

- Retarget all Strike engagement with Kit offers (60-day guarantee prominent)
- Activate UGC: "What's in your Kit?" campaign using seeded content from instructors
- Email nurture: "The Intentional Movement Guide" — educational content, not sales
- Studio partners begin selling Kits as "recommended member gear"

### Strike Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Kit sales (first 30 days) | 200+ Kits | Shopify |
| Email list growth | +2,000 subscribers | Klaviyo |
| Social reach (paid + organic) | 500K+ impressions | Platform analytics |
| Studio partnership conversions | 50+ Kit sales via studio QR | UTM tracking |
| "Intentional Movement" search volume | Baseline → measurable increase | Google Trends |
| UGC posts (#MyIntusKit) | 50+ within 30 days | Social listening |
