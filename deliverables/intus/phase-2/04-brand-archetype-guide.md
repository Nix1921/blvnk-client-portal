**Date:** February 2026

## 1. Archetype Selection Process

### Psychographic Analysis of Target Customer

The Hybrid Athlete is defined by these psychological traits:

| Trait | Expression | Archetype Resonance |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Seeks meaning in daily action** | Chooses reformer Pilates over random gym sessions. Walks instead of drives when possible. | Magician (transformation of ordinary → meaningful) |
| **Rejects hustle culture** | Wants to move with intention, not punish their body. "Grounded alternative to hustle culture." | Sage (wisdom, thoughtfulness over aggression) |
| **Values authenticity over logos** | Prefers minimal style with precise cuts. Dislikes loud branding. | Creator (self-expression through restraint) |
| **Identity-driven purchasing** | Buys into lifestyle, not just product. Community-seeking (#itsallyou). | Magician (identity transformation) |
| **Bridges multiple worlds** | Gym → studio → coffee → work. Doesn't segment life into compartments. | Magician (dissolves boundaries, creates unity) |

### Archetype Scoring Matrix

| Archetype | Brand Name Fit | Target Psyche Fit | Category Fit | Competitive Differentiation | Total |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------------|-------|
| **Magician** | 5/5 ("Within" = inner transformation) | 5/5 (meaning-seeking, identity-driven) | 5/5 (Category Design = creating new reality) | 5/5 (no competitor uses this archetype) | **20/20** |
| **Sage** | 4/5 ("Intentional" = wisdom) | 4/5 (thoughtful, anti-hustle) | 4/5 (philosophy-driven brand) | 4/5 (Vuori is closest but positions as Explorer) | **16/20** |
| **Explorer** | 3/5 (inner journey, some alignment) | 3/5 (freedom-seeking but not primary driver) | 3/5 (exploration ≠ category creation) | 2/5 (Vuori owns this, Lorna Jane claims "Active Living") | **11/20** |
| **Hero** | 2/5 ("Champion" value, but forced) | 2/5 (hustle-adjacent, could backfire) | 2/5 (Hero = "better", not "different") | 1/5 (Gymshark, LSKD, Nike all play Hero) | **7/20** |
| **Creator** | 3/5 (self-expression angle) | 3/5 (aesthetic-driven segment) | 2/5 (Creator builds artifacts, not categories) | 2/5 (fashion-forward brands claim this) | **10/20** |

### Selection: Magician (Primary) + Sage (Secondary)

**Quadrant Clash Check:**
- Magician = Risk/Mastery quadrant
- Sage = Independence/Fulfillment quadrant
- **No clash.** Adjacent quadrants. Magician provides the transformative energy; Sage provides the philosophical grounding. Together they create: *a brand that transforms your relationship with movement through wisdom, not force.*

## 2. Primary Archetype: The Magician

### Archetype Profile

| Dimension | The Magician |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Core Desire** | To understand the fundamental laws of the universe and make dreams reality |
| **Goal** | Transform reality, create something magical from the ordinary |
| **Fear** | Unintended negative consequences |
| **Strategy** | Develop a vision and live it |
| **Gift** | Finding win-win solutions, catalyzing change |
| **Shadow** | Manipulation, disconnection from reality |
| **Voice** | Visionary, assured, transformative |
| **Brand Promise** | "I can make it happen — I can transform your experience" |

### Why Magician for Intus

1. **The Name IS the Archetype.** "Intus" means "within" — the Magician's power source is always internal. The brand name literally describes where transformation originates.

2. **The Category IS Transformation.** "Intentional Movement" transforms the mundane act of getting dressed into a philosophical practice. It transforms a gym visit into a meaningful ritual. It transforms a bundle discount into a daily uniform. This is Magician territory.

3. **"The Kit" IS Alchemy.** The Kit takes two ordinary pieces of clothing (tank + shorts) and transforms them into something greater than the sum of their parts — a curated identity. This is the Magician's signature move: turning base materials into gold.

4. **No Competitor Occupies This Space.**
   - Gymshark = Hero ("Be a visionary")
   - LSKD = Hero ("1% Better Every Day")
   - Lorna Jane = Caregiver/Ruler ("Active Living" as prescription)
   - Vuori = Explorer ("Investment in Happiness" / coastal freedom)
   - Echt = Everyman (accessible, variety, frequent sales)
   - STAX = Lover (fashion-forward, body-positive, sensory)
   - **Magician is completely unoccupied in Australian activewear.**

5. **Magician Survives the Tremble Test.** If competitors shift positioning, the Magician archetype holds because it's anchored in the brand's etymology (Intus = within = transformation from inside). A competitor would need to change their name and entire philosophy to copy this.

### Magician Expression Across Touchpoints

| Touchpoint | Magician Expression | What It's NOT |
|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Product naming** | Evocative, elemental (Zyra, Eclipse, Unity) — suggests transformation states | Not technical specs (FlexWeave 3.0) or performance jargon |
| **Photography** | Captures the *moment of transition* — leaving the studio, arriving at the cafe, the in-between | Not gym action shots or posed fitness photography |
| **Copy** | "The power within" / "Transform how you move" / "Intention starts inside" | Not "crush your workout" or "outperform the competition" |
| **Social content** | POV: "Watch how this changes" — showing transformations in perspective, not body | Not before/after body transformations or workout tutorials |
| **Retail/studio presence** | Feels like entering a different state — curated, intentional, calm | Not high-energy, loud music, aggressive merchandising |
| **Packaging** | Unboxing is a ritual — thoughtful, layered, reveals The Kit as a unified identity | Not just product in a mailer bag |
| **Email** | Subject lines that promise transformation: "You're about to see movement differently" | Not "SALE: 30% off everything" or "New arrivals just dropped" |

---

## 3. Secondary Archetype: The Sage

### Archetype Profile

| Dimension | The Sage |
|-----------|---------|
| **Core Desire** | To find the truth, understand the world |
| **Goal** | Use intelligence and analysis to understand the world |
| **Fear** | Being duped, ignorance, being misled |
| **Strategy** | Seek out information and knowledge |
| **Gift** | Wisdom, intelligence, expertise |
| **Shadow** | Ivory tower disconnection, overthinking |
| **Voice** | Thoughtful, authoritative, considered |
| **Brand Promise** | "I can help you think about this differently" |

### Why Sage as Secondary

1. **"Intentional" IS a Sage Word.** The category name itself ("Intentional Movement") carries Sage energy — it asks customers to *think* about movement, not just do it.

2. **Content Strategy Demands It.** Phase 1B identified "Movement philosophy content" as a Blue Ocean factor to *create*. This is pure Sage territory — educational, perspective-shifting content that no competitor produces.

3. **Counterbalances the Magician's Shadow.** The Magician's risk is perceived manipulation or empty mysticism. The Sage grounds the transformation in real philosophy, real wisdom, real substance. Together: *magical but not mystical, transformative but not superficial.*

4. **Anti-Hustle Positioning.** The Sage rejects the "no days off" Hero mentality that dominates activewear. It says: "Move with thought, not force." This directly appeals to the Hybrid Athlete's rejection of hustle culture.

### Sage Expression Across Touchpoints

| Touchpoint | Sage Expression |
|------------|----------------|
| **Content** | "The Intentional Movement Guide" — educational content about why movement matters, not just how to exercise |
| **Product descriptions** | Explains the *intention* behind each design choice, not just features |
| **Social** | Thought-provoking questions: "When was the last time you moved without a goal?" |
| **Email** | Knowledge-sharing: movement philosophy, mindfulness in motion, the science of intentional practice |
| **Brand voice** | Considered, never rushed. Short sentences with weight. Statements, not exclamations. |

## 4. Archetype Blend Ratio

### 70% Magician / 30% Sage

| Context | Blend | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Product & Packaging** | 80/20 Magician | The product IS the transformation. Sage provides the "why" in product descriptions. |
| **Social Content** | 70/30 | Magician creates the visual magic (transitions, transformations). Sage provides the thoughtful captions and questions. |
| **Email & CRM** | 60/40 | More Sage in nurture sequences — build understanding before asking for the sale. |
| **Website Copy** | 70/30 | Homepage leads with Magician (transformation promise). About page leans Sage (the philosophy). |
| **Studio Partnerships** | 50/50 | Equal blend — the studio IS the transformative space (Magician), and the partnership IS the credible endorsement (Sage). |
| **Lightning Strike** | 80/20 Magician | Launch demands energy and transformation. Sage provides the POV depth ("What do you do between workouts?"). |

## 5. Archetype Consistency Rules

### Always

- **Always** lead with transformation, follow with wisdom
- **Always** show the in-between moments (Magician dissolves boundaries)
- **Always** ask questions that shift perspective (Sage provokes thought)
- **Always** frame The Kit as an identity transformation, not a purchase
- **Always** use "intentional" as the connective word between archetype and category
- **Always** photograph people in transition states — never static poses

### Never

- **Never** use aggressive/competitive language (Hero territory — belongs to Gymshark/LSKD)
- **Never** use overtly sensual/body-focused imagery (Lover territory — belongs to STAX)
- **Never** use "hustle", "grind", "no excuses", "beast mode" (Hero shadow)
- **Never** promise transformation without substance (Magician shadow = manipulation)
- **Never** lecture or condescend (Sage shadow = ivory tower)
- **Never** discount The Kit (undermines the Magician's alchemy — you don't discount magic)
- **Never** use "buttery soft", "squat-proof", or generic activewear vocabulary (breaks both archetypes)

## 6. Competitive Archetype Map

### The Australian Activewear Archetype Landscape

```
        INDEPENDENCE / FULFILLMENT
                |
    Sage        |        Explorer
    (INTUS 2nd) |        (Vuori)
                |
RISK/MASTERY ---+--- BELONGING/ENJOYMENT
                |
    Magician    |        Everyman
    (INTUS 1st) |        (Echt)
                |
        STABILITY / CONTROL

    Hero: Gymshark, LSKD, Nike
    Caregiver/Ruler: Lorna Jane
    Lover: STAX
    Outlaw: (unoccupied)
    Creator: (unoccupied)
    Jester: (unoccupied)
```

**Intus occupies the Magician-Sage corridor — entirely uncontested in Australian activewear.**

The nearest competitor archetype (Vuori as Explorer) is in an adjacent quadrant but a fundamentally different position. Explorer seeks external freedom; Magician seeks internal transformation. No collision.

## 7. Archetype-to-Category Alignment Verification

| Category Element | Archetype Alignment | Status |
|-----------------|--------------------| ------|
| "Intentional Movement" category name | Magician (transformation of meaning) + Sage (intentionality as wisdom) | ALIGNED |
| "The Kit" product concept | Magician (alchemy — two items become one identity) | ALIGNED |
| "Within" brand philosophy | Magician (inner transformation) | ALIGNED |
| 60-day return policy | Magician (confidence in transformation) + Sage (trust through transparency) | ALIGNED |
| Pilates studio partnerships | Magician (studio as transformative space) + Sage (instructor as credible authority) | ALIGNED |
| "What do you do between workouts?" POV | Sage (reframing the question) + Magician (dissolving the gym/life boundary) | ALIGNED |
| Bundle-as-identity pricing | Magician (transforms price mechanic into identity purchase) | ALIGNED |
| STAX US gap exploitation | Sage (strategic wisdom — exploit confirmed market gap) | ALIGNED |

**All 8 category elements align with the Magician/Sage archetype blend. No contradictions detected.**

## 8. Integration Outputs to Downstream Departments

| To | Output |
|----|--------|
| **Narrative & Verbal** | Magician/Sage voice dimensions. The word "intentional" as brand vocabulary anchor. Transformation language (not competition language). Question-based engagement (Sage). Never use Hero vocabulary. |
| **Creative & Visual** | Magician visual codes: transition moments, alchemy (two → one), "in-between" photography. Sage visual codes: clean space, considered composition, quiet confidence. See Section 2 touchpoint table. |
| **Digital & Systems** | Magician UX: The Kit builder should feel like a ritual, not a cart. Sage UX: Product pages explain intention behind design. Avoid aggressive conversion tactics (breaks both archetypes). |
| **Distribution & Growth** | Magician content: transformation POVs, before/after perspective shifts (not body). Sage content: movement philosophy, "Intentional Movement Guide." Lightning Strike = 80/20 Magician/Sage. |
