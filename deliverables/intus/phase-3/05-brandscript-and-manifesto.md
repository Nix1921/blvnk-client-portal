# BrandScript & Brand Manifesto — Intus
**Department:** Narrative & Verbal Identity
**Phase:** 3A | Launch Kit
**Date:** February 2026

## 1. Brand Architecture

### Model: Branded House

Intus operates as a single unified brand. All product lines (Zyra, Core, Unity, Agility, Eclipse) live under the Intus master identity. There are no sub-brands or endorsed brands.

| Element | Decision | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Architecture | Branded House | Early-stage startup — maximize equity under one name. Every touchpoint builds "Intus." |
| Product naming | Collection names (Zyra, Eclipse, etc.) | Evocative, elemental names that suggest transformation states — aligned with Magician archetype. |
| Naming convention | Latin/elemental roots | Consistent with "Intus" (Latin for "within"). Future collections should follow this convention. |

## 2. StoryBrand SB7 Framework — The Intus BrandScript

### 1. A Character (The Hero)

**The Hybrid Athlete.**

You move between reformer class, coffee with friends, a walking meeting, and evening stretching — all in a single day. You don't separate "gym time" from "real life." You're value-conscious but won't compromise on quality. You want clothes that understand how you actually live, not just how you work out.

*Note: The customer is ALWAYS the hero. Intus is NEVER the hero.*

### 2. Has a Problem

**External Problem (tangible):**
Your activewear is designed for one hour at the gym. The rest of your day, you're changing, layering, or settling for clothes that don't feel right.

**Internal Problem (emotional):**
You feel like no brand actually gets you. The gym brands feel too aggressive. The fashion brands feel too expensive. The budget brands feel disposable. You're stuck in between — and that in-between is where you actually live.

**Philosophical Problem (moral):**
It shouldn't be this hard. Movement is natural. Dressing for your day should be natural too. Why does the industry make you choose between gym clothes and real clothes?

**The Villain:**
The false divide between "workout" and "life" — the idea that you need separate wardrobes for separate selves.

### 3. Meets a Guide (Intus)

**Empathy Statement:**
We know what it's like to move through a whole day — studio to street to social — and want to feel right the entire time. Not just for the workout. For everything in between.

**Authority Signals:**
- Designed in Melbourne for the Hybrid Athlete's full day
- Curated Kits (not random bundles) built around how you actually move
- 60-day guarantee — wear it, live in it, and if it doesn't transform how you dress, return it
- Endorsed by Pilates studios (partner instructors wear The Kit in class)

### 4. Who Gives Them a Plan

**Process Plan (3 Steps):**

| Step | Action | Psychological Trigger |
|------|--------|-----------------------|
| 1 | **Choose Your Kit** | Identity selection (not product selection). "Which Kit matches your day?" |
| 2 | **Wear It Everywhere** | Permission to break the gym/life divide. 60-day guarantee removes risk. |
| 3 | **Move With Intention** | Transformation complete. You're not wearing activewear — you're dressed for intentional movement. |

**Agreement Plan (Guarantees):**
- 60-day wear-and-return guarantee (including worn items)
- Free shipping on orders over $150 AUD / $200 USD
- Afterpay/Klarna available ($25/fortnight)

### 5. Calls Them to Action

**Direct CTA:** "Get Your Kit"

**Transitional CTAs:**
- "Take the Kit Quiz" (which Kit matches your day?)
- "Read the Movement Guide" (educational content — Sage expression)
- "See What's In My Kit" (UGC gallery — social proof)

*Never use: "Shop Now", "Buy Now", "Submit", "Learn More"*

### 6. Helps Them Avoid Failure

**What happens if you do nothing:**
- You keep buying gym clothes that only work at the gym
- You keep changing 2-3 times a day
- You keep feeling like no brand understands your actual lifestyle
- You keep settling for "good enough" instead of intentional

**The stakes (loss aversion framing):**
"Every day you dress without intention is a day you move through life on autopilot."

### 7. Ends in Success

**External Success:** One Kit. Your whole day. No more changing, no more compromising, no more outfit anxiety.

**Internal Success:** You feel understood. A brand finally gets that your life doesn't happen in segments. You move with purpose, dressed with intention, confident from studio to street.

**Philosophical Success:** Movement has meaning again. Not as punishment. Not as performance. As an expression of who you are — from within.

**Status Transformation:** From "someone who wears gym clothes" → "someone who dresses for intentional movement."

## 3. The One-Liner

**Problem:** Most activewear is designed for the gym — but your life doesn't happen in a gym.

**Solution:** Intus creates curated Kits for the Hybrid Athlete's entire day.

**Result:** Move through your whole day with intention, dressed in one Kit that works everywhere.

**Full One-Liner:**
*"Most activewear is designed for one hour at the gym. Intus creates Kits for the other 23. Move with intention — from studio, to street, to everywhere in between."*

## 4. Brand Manifesto

### Framework: The Declaration + The Vignette (Hybrid)

---

**WITHIN**

You don't have a gym self and a real self.
You have one body. One day. One way of moving through it.

The alarm goes off. You reach for The Kit — not because it's workout gear, not because it's casual wear, but because it's yours. Designed for how you actually live.

Reformer at 6:30.
Coffee at 8.
A meeting that could've been an email at 10.
A walk because you needed to think at noon.
Groceries. A friend. An evening stretch on the living room floor.

Every one of those is movement. Every one of those counts.

We didn't build Intus for the highlight reel.
We built it for the full day — the transitions, the in-betweens, the moments nobody photographs but everybody lives.

Because "within" isn't just our name.
It's where intention starts.
It's where movement begins.
It's where you've always had everything you need.

Move with intention.
The power is within.

| "We didn't build Intus for the highlight reel" | Sage (honest, anti-performance) | Authenticity signal |

## 5. Narrative Architecture — Five Pillars

| Pillar | Expression for Intus |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Purpose** | To transform the relationship between people and movement — from performance to intention. |
| **Belief** | Every movement counts. Not just the ones that make you sweat. |
| **Story Spine** | The Hybrid Athlete moves through their entire day in one Kit, dissolving the false divide between "workout" and "life." |
| **Expression System** | Magician voice (transformative, assured) + Sage voice (thoughtful, considered). See Deliverable 6 for full voice guide. |
| **Delivery Framework** | Owned: Website, email, studio partnerships. Not rented: social algorithms drive awareness, not dependence. |

---

## 6. Integration Outputs to Downstream Departments

| To | Output |
|----|--------|
| **Creative & Visual** | Manifesto text for visual treatment. Vignette structure (daily sequence) for photography shot list. "Transition moments" as the visual narrative. |
| **Digital & Systems** | BrandScript for website structure: Hero section (character + problem), Guide section (empathy + authority), Plan section (3 steps), CTA ("Get Your Kit"), Success section (transformation). Microcopy direction in Deliverable 6. |
| **Distribution & Growth** | One-Liner for all ad copy anchoring. "What do you do between workouts?" as social content hook. Manifesto for email welcome sequence anchor. |
