## 1. Voice Dimensions

### The Intus Voice: Magician (70%) + Sage (30%)

The Intus voice sounds like a thoughtful friend who sees things differently — someone who makes you pause and rethink what you thought you knew, without ever lecturing you. Assured but never arrogant. Quiet but never passive. Transformative but always grounded.

| Dimension | Expression | What It Sounds Like | What It NEVER Sounds Like |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Personality** | Intentional, assured, warm, perceptive | A reformer instructor who also reads philosophy | A personal trainer yelling at you / A fashion brand being aloof |
| **Style** | Short sentences with weight. Statements over exclamations. Questions that reframe. | "You don't need more clothes. You need the right Kit." | "OMG you NEED this!! Shop now!! Limited time!!" |
| **Vocabulary** | Intentional, movement, within, Kit, curated, transition, flow, purpose | Words that suggest awareness and transformation | "Crush it", "beast mode", "hustle", "slay", "buttery soft" |
| **Energy** | Calm confidence. 6/10 on the intensity scale. Rises to 7/10 for launches, drops to 5/10 for nurture. | Steady, rhythmic, like a walking pace | Never breathless, never urgent, never aggressive |

### Tone Map (Context-Specific Adjustments)

| Situation | Tone Adjustment | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Product launch** | Energy rises to 7/10. More Magician. | "Something is about to change how you dress. The Reformer Kit is here." |
| **Educational content** | Sage forward (60/40). Reflective, questioning. | "When was the last time you moved without a destination?" |
| **Customer service** | Warm, direct, solution-oriented. No blame. | "That doesn't sound right. Let's sort this out — reply here or DM us." |
| **Social captions** | Conversational, observation-based. Short. | "Studio → flat white → everywhere else. One Kit." |
| **Email nurture** | Sage forward. Building understanding. | "You're about to see your wardrobe differently. Here's why." |
| **Sale/promotion** | DOES NOT EXIST. Intus does not run sales. Price integrity is a core signal. | N/A — see "Forbidden Contexts" below |
| **Error/issue** | Human, accountable, immediate solution. | "We got that wrong. Here's what we're doing about it." |

### Forbidden Contexts

The Intus voice is NEVER used for:
- Discount/sale language (The Kit is never discounted)
- Urgency-based promotion ("Hurry!", "Last chance!", countdown timers)
- Competitive comparison ("Better than Brand X")
- Body-focused messaging ("Get your dream body", "Look amazing")
- Hustle culture language ("No excuses", "Rise and grind")

## 2. Word Bank

### Power Words (Use Frequently)

| Category | Words |
|----------|-------|
| **Movement** | intentional, flow, transition, movement, purpose, rhythm, practice |
| **Identity** | within, Kit, curated, yours, chosen, daily, ritual |
| **Transformation** | shift, change, transform, reframe, dissolve, become, emerge |
| **Quality** | considered, crafted, designed, built, precise, refined |
| **Feeling** | confident, grounded, right, natural, seamless, effortless |
| **Community** | circle, together, collective, shared, studio, club |

### Community Words (Brand-Specific Vocabulary)

| Term | Definition | Usage |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **The Kit** | A curated top + bottom combination designed as a daily uniform. Always capitalized. | "Get Your Kit" / "What's in your Kit?" |
| **Intentional Movement** | The category Intus owns. Movement with awareness and purpose through the full day. | "Designed for Intentional Movement" |
| **Hybrid Athlete** | Intus's target customer. Someone who moves between gym, studio, street, and social life. | "Built for the Hybrid Athlete" |
| **The Within** | The inner space where intention begins. Brand philosophy shorthand. | "It starts from Within" |
| **Transition** | The moments between activities — leaving the studio, arriving at the cafe. Intus's signature moment. | Photography, content, and copy focus |

### Forbidden Words (Never Use)

| Word/Phrase | Why | Replace With |
|-------------|-----|-------------|
| "Buttery soft" | Generic activewear cliche. Zero differentiation. | Describe the feeling: "moves with you" / "second-skin feel" |
| "Squat-proof" | Performance jargon. Reduces brand to gym context. | "Built for your full day" |
| "Sweat-wicking" | Technical commodity language. | "Designed to perform from studio to street" |
| "Hustle" / "Grind" / "Beast mode" | Hero archetype — belongs to Gymshark/LSKD. | "Move with intention" / "Your practice, your pace" |
| "No excuses" / "No days off" | Toxic fitness culture. Contradicts Sage philosophy. | "Every movement counts" |
| "Buttery" / "Silky" / "Luxe" | Sensory Lover archetype — belongs to STAX. | "Considered" / "Refined" / "Precise" |
| "Sale" / "Discount" / "% off" | Undermines Magician alchemy. You don't discount magic. | N/A — Intus does not run sales |
| "Best" / "Leading" / "#1" | Unsubstantiated claims. Breaks Sage authenticity. | Show, don't claim. Let studio partnerships and UGC speak. |
| "Eco-friendly" (as standalone) | Vague sustainability language. | Specific: "Made with recycled polyester" or "Certified by [X]" |
| "Click here" / "Submit" | Dead-end UX language. | "Get Your Kit" / "Start Your Practice" / "Join the Circle" |

>
> It's Latin. It's where intention starts. And it's the one place every Hybrid Athlete already has everything they need.
>
> We built Intus because we were tired of activewear designed for one hour at the gym. We move through reformer classes, coffee runs, walking meetings, and evening stretches — all in a single day. We needed clothes that moved with us.
>
> So we made The Kit. Not a bundle. Not a discount. A curated daily uniform for intentional movement.
>
> This isn't about the workout. It's about the full day.
> It's about what you do between workouts.
> It's about moving with purpose.
>
> The power is within.

*Me/You ratio: 60% you/your, 40% we/our — About page is the one context where "we" is higher because it's the brand origin story. Still customer-focused in framing.*
