# Brand Identity System — Intus
**Department:** Creative & Visual Arts Studio
**Phase:** 3B | Launch Kit
**Date:** February 2026

---

## 1. Visual Strategy

### Positioning Tier: Elevated Mid-Range (Between Mass and Luxury)

Intus sits in a specific visual territory — not luxury (that's Vuori, Alo Yoga), not mass (that's Echt, Shein), but **elevated essential**. The visual system must signal quality and intention without signaling inaccessibility.

| Visual Code | Luxury | Intus (Elevated Mid-Range) | Mass |
|-------------|--------|---------------------------|------|
| Whitespace | 60%+ | 45-55% | 30-40% |
| Color palette | 2-3 colors, muted | 3-4 colors, warm neutrals + 1 accent | 5+ colors, saturated |
| Typography | Serif, custom | Clean sans-serif, geometric | Bold sans-serif, condensed |
| Photography | Editorial, aspirational | Lifestyle-transitional, natural light | Product-focused, studio lit |
| Grid | Asymmetric, art-directed | Modular, consistent | Dense, information-heavy |

### Archetype Visual Expression

**Magician (Primary — 70%):**
- Transformative visual moments (before/after perspective, not body)
- Warm tonal shifts (light → shadow, indoor → outdoor)
- Elements that suggest alchemy (two things becoming one — The Kit)
- Circular/flowing geometry (cycles, transitions, continuity)

**Sage (Secondary — 30%):**
- Clean, considered composition with intentional negative space
- Quiet confidence — no visual noise
- Typography-forward layouts for editorial/educational content
- Restrained palette (wisdom = restraint)

## 2. Color System

### Primary Palette

| Color | Name | Hex | Psychology | Usage |
|-------|------|-----|-----------|-------|
| Deep Charcoal | **Within** | #2C2C2C | Depth, grounding, sophistication without pretension | Primary text, logo, headers |
| Warm White | **Canvas** | #F5F0EB | Openness, warmth, invitation (not clinical white) | Backgrounds, breathing space |
| Warm Sand | **Ground** | #D4C5B2 | Earth, stability, natural movement | Secondary backgrounds, cards, dividers |

### Accent Palette

| Color | Name | Hex | Psychology | Usage |
|-------|------|-----|-----------|-------|
| Burnt Terracotta | **Intention** | #C4704E | Warmth, energy, transformation — Magician's fire | CTAs, highlights, "Get Your Kit" buttons |
| Deep Sage | **Thought** | #7A8B7A | Wisdom, nature, grounded philosophy — Sage's voice | Secondary accents, educational content, tags |

### Extended Palette (Seasonal)

| Color | Name | Hex | Usage |
|-------|------|-----|-------|
| Soft Clay | **Dawn** | #E8D5C4 | Seasonal Kit colorways, packaging |
| Deep Navy | **Depth** | #1E2A3A | Men's collection emphasis, winter seasonal |

### Color Ratios

| Context | 60% (Dominant) | 30% (Secondary) | 10% (Accent) |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Website | Canvas (#F5F0EB) | Within (#2C2C2C) + Ground (#D4C5B2) | Intention (#C4704E) |
| Email | Canvas | Within | Intention (CTA only) |
| Social | Ground or Canvas | Within | Intention |
| Packaging | Canvas + Ground | Within | Intention (interior detail) |

### Color Rules

- **Never** use pure white (#FFFFFF) — always Canvas (#F5F0EB) for warmth
- **Never** use pure black (#000000) — always Within (#2C2C2C) for depth without harshness
- **Never** use Intention (terracotta) for body text — accent only
- **Never** use more than 3 colors in a single composition
- Thought (sage green) is reserved for Sage-expression contexts: educational content, philosophy sections, editorial
- All color combinations must pass WCAG AA contrast minimum (4.5:1 for text)

### Contrast Verification

| Pair | Ratio | WCAG |
|------|-------|------|
| Within on Canvas | 11.2:1 | AAA |
| Within on Ground | 5.8:1 | AA |
| Canvas on Within | 11.2:1 | AAA |
| Intention on Canvas | 4.6:1 | AA |
| Intention on Within | 3.1:1 | Decorative use only |

## 3. Logo System

### Design Direction

The Intus logo should embody: transformation, interiority, and the dissolving of boundaries (Magician) with considered restraint (Sage).

**Logo Construction Framework:**

| Element | Direction | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Wordmark | Clean geometric sans-serif. Custom letterforms for "I" and "S". | Sage clarity + Magician subtlety. The custom letters carry hidden meaning. |
| Logomark (optional) | Abstract circle with interior movement — suggesting "within" | Magician (internal transformation). Circle = wholeness, continuity, the full day. |
| Construction grid | Golden Ratio (phi) proportions for letter spacing and mark | Mathematical precision = Sage credibility |

**Logo Variations Required:**

| Variant | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| Primary (wordmark + mark) | Website header, packaging, hero placements |
| Wordmark only | Social profiles, email headers, small applications |
| Mark only | Favicon, app icon, embroidery, repeat patterns |
| Reversed (Canvas on Within) | Dark backgrounds, photography overlays |
| Monochrome (Within only) | Print, embossing, single-color applications |

**Logo Clear Space:** Minimum clear space = height of the "I" in "INTUS" on all sides.

**Logo Minimum Size:** 24px height (digital), 10mm height (print).

**Logo Don'ts:**
- Never stretch, rotate, or distort
- Never place on busy/patterned backgrounds without sufficient contrast
- Never add effects (shadows, gradients, outlines)
- Never change the color palette
- Never recreate in a non-approved typeface

## 4. Typography System

### Type Scale (Modular Scale: 1.25 ratio — Major Third)

| Level | Size (px) | Weight | Use |
|-------|-----------|--------|-----|
| Display | 48 / 3rem | Light (300) | Hero headlines, manifesto text |
| H1 | 38 / 2.375rem | Regular (400) | Page titles |
| H2 | 30 / 1.875rem | Regular (400) | Section headers |
| H3 | 24 / 1.5rem | Medium (500) | Subsection headers |
| Body | 16 / 1rem | Regular (400) | Paragraph text, descriptions |
| Body Small | 14 / 0.875rem | Regular (400) | Captions, metadata |
| Micro | 12 / 0.75rem | Medium (500) | Labels, tags, legal |

### Font Selection Direction

| Role | Direction | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Primary (Headlines)** | Geometric sans-serif with humanist warmth (e.g., Neue Montreal, General Sans, or Satoshi) | Magician: geometric precision suggests transformation through design. Sage: clean legibility signals thoughtfulness. Humanist warmth prevents clinical coldness. |
| **Secondary (Body)** | Inter or system sans-serif | Maximum readability. Sage: clarity over decoration. |

**Typography Rules:**
- Line height: 1.5 for body, 1.2 for headlines
- Letter spacing: +0.02em for all-caps micro text, 0 for body, -0.01em for display
- Maximum line width: 65-75 characters for body text
- Never use italic for emphasis — use Medium weight instead
- Never use ALL CAPS for more than 3 words consecutively (except micro labels)

## 5. Photography Direction

### The Signature Moment: Transition

The Intus visual language captures **the space between** — the moment of leaving, arriving, transitioning. This is the Magician's territory: dissolving the boundary between "workout" and "life."

### Shot Types

| Shot Type | Description | Archetype | Example |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **The Transition** | Subject moving between environments — leaving the studio door, sitting at a cafe, walking down a street | Magician | Walking out of a Pilates studio into morning light, Kit visible, bag over shoulder |
| **The Full Day** | Time-lapse or sequence showing the same Kit across multiple activities | Magician | 4-panel: reformer → coffee → walking → evening stretch |
| **The Detail** | Close-up of fabric, stitching, or design detail with natural light | Sage | Fabric texture caught in afternoon light, fingers touching seam |
| **The Collective** | Two or more Hybrid Athletes together in a non-gym setting | Sage/Magician | Friends in Kits at a cafe table, post-studio, natural and candid |

### Photography Rules

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| **Natural light only.** No studio flash, no ring lights. | Magician: natural light creates transformation (golden hour, morning light). Sage: honesty — no artificial enhancement. |
| **Location: always in transition.** Doorways, streets, cafes, parks — never inside a gym. | The Kit is for the full day. Gym photography contradicts the POV. |
| **Subjects: mid-movement or just-arrived.** Never static poses, never "looking at camera and smiling." | Magician: movement = transformation. Sage: candid = authentic. |
| **Wardrobe: always The Kit.** Never styled with non-Intus pieces in hero shots. | The Kit is the identity. Mixing dilutes the alchemy. |
| **Diversity: reflect the Hybrid Athlete.** Multiple body types, ethnicities, genders. No fitness-model casting. | Sage: wisdom doesn't discriminate. Magician: transformation is for everyone. |
| **Color grading: warm, slightly desaturated.** Match the Canvas/Ground palette. | Consistent visual temperature. Never cold/blue-toned (clinical). Never oversaturated (mass-market). |
| **Never show price or promotional text on photography.** | Magician: you don't put a price tag on magic. Sage: photography is for meaning, not selling. |

### Mood References

| Mood | Visual Language |
|------|----------------|
| Melbourne morning | Cool light warming to gold. Empty streets. A figure walking with purpose. |
| Post-studio calm | Slight perspiration. Hair up. Coffee in hand. Sitting outside. Natural. |
| Evening transition | Golden hour. A stretch on the balcony. Movement slowing down. |
| The collective | Friends together, not performing. Laughter. Walking. Real moments. |

## 6. Packaging Specifications

### Packaging Philosophy: Unboxing as Ritual

The Kit arrives as a unified identity, not separate items in a bag. The packaging IS the Magician's reveal — two items become one Kit through the unboxing experience.

| Element | Specification | Rationale |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Outer mailer** | Matte finish, Ground (#D4C5B2) base, Within (#2C2C2C) wordmark | Matte = naturalness, trust (not glossy mass-market). Ground color = warmth. |
| **Interior** | Canvas (#F5F0EB) tissue paper, single printed line: "The power is within." | Magician reveal. The message is discovered, not displayed. |
| **Kit wrap** | Both Kit pieces wrapped together (not separately) in a single band | Alchemy: two items presented as one identity. The Kit is ONE product. |
| **Kit band** | Terracotta (#C4704E) paper band with Kit name printed | Accent color at the moment of reveal. "The Reformer Kit" — identity, not SKU. |
| **Insert** | Card stock, 100x150mm: "Your Kit. Your day. Move with intention." + care instructions on reverse | Sage: considered, useful. Not a promotional flyer. |
| **Material** | Recycled cardstock, soy-based inks, no plastic | Sustainability as baseline (per Phase 1A intelligence), not selling point. |

## 7. Integration Outputs to Downstream Departments

| To | Output |
|----|--------|
| **Digital & Systems** | Color tokens (hex values), typography scale, 8pt grid specs, button styles (Intention terracotta), photography specs for web implementation. |
| **Distribution & Growth** | Social media visual templates, photography direction for content shoots, packaging unboxing sequence for UGC potential. |
| **Narrative & Verbal** | Visual-verbal alignment confirmed: warm neutral palette matches assured/warm voice. Terracotta accent matches Magician transformation energy. |
