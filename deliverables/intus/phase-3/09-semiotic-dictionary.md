# Semiotic Dictionary — Intus
**Department:** Creative & Visual Arts Studio
**Phase:** 3B | Launch Kit
**Date:** February 2026

---

## Purpose

This dictionary maps every visual and verbal sign in the Intus brand system to its intended meaning. It ensures semiotic consistency — that every signifier (what customers see/hear) triggers the correct signified (what they understand/feel). If a sign points to the wrong meaning, the brand fractures.

## 1. Core Signs

### The Brand Name

| Sign | Signifier | Signified | Type |
|------|-----------|-----------|------|
| **"Intus"** | Latin word, unfamiliar but pronounceable | Inner power, hidden depth, something beneath the surface. Not foreign — foundational. | Symbol (arbitrary convention, requires learning) |
| **"Within"** | Preposition of interiority | The source is inside you, not external. Self-reliance without isolation. | Index (causal: "within" → internal origin) |

**Semiotic Risk:** If "Intus" is never explained, it reads as generic brand gibberish. The Latin origin MUST be communicated early (About page, welcome email, packaging insert) to activate the Magician signified.

### The Kit

| Sign | Signifier | Signified | Type |
|------|-----------|-----------|------|
| **"The Kit"** (capitalized) | A curated set, unified by name | Identity product, not a bundle discount. You don't "buy two items" — you "get your Kit." | Symbol |
| **Kit wrap band** (terracotta) | Two pieces bound together by a single band | Alchemy — two things becoming one. The transformation happens at the moment of unboxing. | Icon (visually represents unity) |
| **Kit naming** (The Reformer Kit, The Street Kit) | Activity-based names | Each Kit has a purpose. Your Kit choice signals your practice, not your size or budget. | Index (name → lifestyle) |

### The Category

| Sign | Signifier | Signified | Type |
|------|-----------|-----------|------|
| **"Intentional Movement"** | Two-word phrase combining awareness + action | A new way to think about exercise — not performance, not punishment, but purposeful daily motion. | Symbol (category name — requires education) |
| **"The other 23 hours"** | Numerical contrast (1 hour gym vs. 23 hours everything else) | The industry has it backwards. The majority of your day matters more than the workout. | Index (number → reframing) |

## 2. Color Signs

| Color | Signifier | Signified | Cultural Code |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Within (#2C2C2C)** | Deep charcoal, almost-black | Depth, grounding, sophistication. Not cold (it's warm charcoal, not cool gray). Not aggressive (it's not pure black). | Premium-accessible. Serious without being intimidating. |
| **Canvas (#F5F0EB)** | Warm off-white | Openness, invitation, natural warmth. Not clinical (that's #FFFFFF). Not blank — warm, like a canvas waiting for intention. | Wellness/natural — aligns with Pilates studio aesthetics, not hospital or tech-sterile. |
| **Ground (#D4C5B2)** | Warm sand/clay | Earth, stability, foundation. The physical ground beneath movement. | Melbourne aesthetic — urban neutral, not beach/coastal (that's Vuori). |
| **Intention (#C4704E)** | Burnt terracotta | Transformation energy, warmth, the spark that initiates change. Magician's fire. | Action without aggression. Warmth without excess. Not red (urgency/danger) — terracotta is red that's been tempered by earth. |
| **Thought (#7A8B7A)** | Deep sage green | Wisdom, nature, philosophy. The Sage's color. | Natural intelligence. Not neon/fresh green (health food) — deep and considered. |

### Color Pairing Semiotics

| Pairing | Reads As | Use |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Within + Canvas | Authority with warmth (Sage-forward) | Body text, editorial, educational content |
| Canvas + Intention | Invitation to transform (Magician-forward) | CTAs, hero sections, product highlights |
| Ground + Within | Grounded stability (foundation) | Secondary sections, card backgrounds |
| Canvas + Thought | Quiet wisdom | Philosophy content, "Movement Guide" |
| Within + Intention | Energized depth | Accent moments, Kit reveals, packaging details |

## 3. Typography Signs

| Element | Signifier | Signified |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Geometric sans-serif (headlines)** | Clean, mathematical letterforms | Precision with warmth. Designed, not decorated. Magician: intentional construction. |
| **Light weight (display)** | Thin strokes, breathing space | Confidence through restraint. You don't need to shout. Sage: quiet authority. |
| **Medium weight (emphasis)** | Slightly heavier than body, not bold | Considered emphasis. Not aggressive (bold) — intentional. |
| **ALL CAPS (micro labels)** | Small text in uppercase | Functional, structured. Used sparingly = signals importance. Overused = loses meaning. |
| **Generous line height (1.5)** | Text breathes, doesn't crowd | Intentionality extends to reading experience. Nothing is rushed. |

### What Typography NEVER Signals

| Never | Because |
|-------|---------|
| Italic | Suggests uncertainty or aside — breaks Magician assurance |
| Bold (heavy weights) | Suggests aggression — Hero archetype territory |
| Script/handwritten | Suggests casualness or femininity — too narrow, breaks dual-gender positioning |
| Condensed type | Suggests urgency or information density — mass-market code |
| Decorative type | Suggests playfulness — Jester territory |

## 4. Photography Signs

| Visual Element | Signifier | Signified |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Natural light** | Sun, window light, golden hour | Authenticity. Nothing hidden, nothing manufactured. Sage: truth needs no studio lighting. |
| **Transition moments** | Doorways, streets between locations, arriving/leaving | The in-between IS the point. Magician: boundaries dissolve. This is where Intus lives. |
| **Warm color grade** | Slightly desaturated, warm tones | Comfort without artifice. Not cold/editorial (luxury) or oversaturated (mass). |
| **Candid subjects** | Not posing, not performing, mid-movement | Real life, not a photoshoot. Sage: authenticity. The subject doesn't know they're being watched — or doesn't care. |
| **Empty space around subject** | Person occupies 40-60% of frame | Room to breathe. Intentional composition. The space IS part of the message. |
| **Two contexts in one frame** | Gym bag + coffee cup. Studio door + street. | The Hybrid Athlete doesn't choose between worlds. The Kit bridges them. |

### What Photography NEVER Shows

| Never | Because |
|-------|---------|
| Gym interiors | Contradicts "the other 23 hours" POV. Intus is not gym-wear. |
| Mirror selfies | Social media cliche. Breaks Sage authenticity. |
| Posed fitness shots | Hero archetype territory (Gymshark, LSKD). |
| Body close-ups | Lover archetype territory (STAX). Intus is about movement, not body. |
| Pure white backgrounds | Clinical, e-commerce generic. Use Canvas or natural settings. |
| Price overlays on images | You don't put a price tag on magic. Keep commerce and photography separate. |

## 5. Material Signs

| Material | Signifier | Signified | Use |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| **Matte cardstock (packaging)** | Smooth, non-reflective surface | Naturalness, trust, considered quality. Not glossy (mass-market). | Mailer, inserts, Kit band |
| **Recycled stock** | Visible fiber texture, slightly imperfect | Intentional sustainability — not performed, embodied. | All paper/card materials |
| **Terracotta accent (Kit band)** | A warm color reveal inside neutral packaging | The Magician's moment — the transformation is discovered inside, not displayed outside. | Kit band around paired items |
| **Fabric (product)** | Mid-weight, structured-but-soft hand feel | "Designed for a full day" — not too technical (gym), not too loose (loungewear). The feel confirms the positioning. | The Kit itself |

---

## 6. Verbal Signs

| Word/Phrase | Signifier | Signified |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **"Get Your Kit"** | Imperative + possessive | This is already yours — you're claiming it, not buying it. Magician: the Kit was always meant for you. |
| **"Move with intention"** | Verb + preposition + noun | Movement is a practice with purpose, not a chore or performance. Sage: awareness transforms action. |
| **"The power is within"** | Declarative, present tense | Transformation doesn't require external products — it starts inside. The brand gives you permission, not power. |
| **"Join the Circle"** | Community metaphor | Equality (circle = no hierarchy). Belonging without exclusion. Not a "team" (hierarchical) or "squad" (casual). |
| **"From studio to street"** | Spatial transition | The Kit bridges environments. Your life is one continuous flow. Magician: boundaries dissolve. |
| **"The other 23"** | Numerical contrast | Reframes the industry's obsession with the workout hour. 23 > 1. The majority wins. |

## 7. Anti-Semiotic Audit — Signs That Contradict the Brand

| Sign | What It Signals | Why It Contradicts Intus |
|------|----------------|-------------------------|
| "SALE" or "% OFF" | Desperation, overstock, low confidence | Magician's alchemy is devalued. You don't discount transformation. |
| Pure black (#000000) | Harshness, absolutism | Intus is warm depth (Within #2C2C2C), not cold authority. |
| Pure white (#FFFFFF) | Clinical, sterile | Intus is warm invitation (Canvas #F5F0EB), not hospital. |
| Glossy packaging | Mass-market, artificial, disposable | Contradicts Sage naturalness and sustainability. |
| Gym photography | Performance culture, body obsession | Contradicts "the other 23 hours" and Sage anti-hustle positioning. |
| Bold/heavy type | Aggression, shouting, urgency | Hero archetype. Intus speaks with Sage assurance, not Hero volume. |
| Countdown timers | Manufactured urgency, scarcity manipulation | Fake scarcity breaks Sage trust permanently. |
| "Best seller" badge | Conformity pressure, generic retail | Intus curates, not ranks. Every Kit is intentional, not popular. |

## 8. Semiotic Consistency Checklist

Before any new asset goes live, verify:

- [ ] Every color used maps to the defined palette and its intended signified
- [ ] Photography shows transition moments, not gym/static/posed
- [ ] Typography weights stay within Light-Medium range (no Bold)
- [ ] All copy uses approved vocabulary (check Word Bank in Deliverable 6)
- [ ] No forbidden words appear anywhere in the asset
- [ ] Material choices match the signified (matte not gloss, recycled not virgin)
- [ ] The Kit is presented as one identity, never as "two items for $X"
- [ ] No price appears on or overlaid on photography
- [ ] Warm tone maintained (no cool/blue color grading)
- [ ] Customer is Hero, brand is Guide (check Me/You ratio if copy-heavy)
