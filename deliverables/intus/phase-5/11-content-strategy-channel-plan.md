# Content Strategy & Channel Plan — Intus
**Department:** Distribution & Growth Engine
**Phase:** 5A | Launch Kit
**Date:** February 2026

---

## 1. Channel Strategy

### Channel Selection (Based on Audience + Goal)

| Channel | Role | Priority | Rationale |
|---------|------|----------|-----------|
| **TikTok** | Discovery + Virality | PRIMARY | Gen Z/Millennial Hybrid Athlete lives here. Completion rate > follower count. "POV" format is native. Interest-based algo means zero followers can still reach millions. |
| **Instagram** | Lifestyle Affinity + Social Proof | PRIMARY | Aesthetic branding home. Saves & Sends = 5x more valuable than likes. UGC (#MyIntusKit) gallery. Studio partnership co-content. |
| **YouTube** | Trust + Search + Long-form | SECONDARY | "The Within Story" documentary anchor. Movement Philosophy content for Sage expression. SEO value compounds. Shorts as bridge to long-form. |
| **Email/SMS (Klaviyo)** | Lifecycle + Retention | PRIMARY | Owned channel — not algorithmic. Welcome sequence, Kit Quiz follow-up, post-purchase nurture. Most Sage-forward channel (60/40 Magician/Sage). |
| **Pinterest** | Visual Discovery + Intent | TERTIARY | "Activewear outfit" search intent. Kit styling boards. Long content lifespan. Low priority at launch, grow post-month-3. |

### Channels NOT Used at Launch

| Channel | Why Not |
|---------|---------|
| Facebook | Declining Gen Z presence. Budget better spent on TikTok/Instagram. Reassess month 6. |
| LinkedIn | Not a lifestyle/consumer channel. Only for B2B partnerships (studios, wholesale). |
| X/Twitter | Not aligned with brand energy. External links penalized 50-90%. Reassess if cultural conversation shifts. |

## 2. Content Architecture: Hub-and-Spoke Flywheel

### The Hub: Weekly Anchor Content

One major content piece per week drives the flywheel. All spoke content derives from it.

| Week Type | Hub Content | Channel | Spoke Outputs |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **Philosophy Week** | Movement Philosophy article/video ("Why every movement counts") | YouTube long-form + Blog | 5 TikToks, 3 Reels, 2 carousel posts, 1 email |
| **Kit Week** | Kit spotlight + styling guide ("3 Ways to Wear The Reformer Kit") | Instagram Reels + Blog | 5 TikToks, 3 IG posts, 1 YouTube Short, 1 email |
| **Community Week** | UGC compilation + studio partner feature | Instagram + TikTok | 3 IG posts, 3 TikToks, 1 YouTube Short, 1 email |
| **Founder Week** | "The Within Story" chapter / behind-the-scenes | YouTube + Instagram | 5 TikToks, 3 Reels, 2 IG Stories, 1 email |

**Target: 1 hub → 15-20 spokes per week = 60-80 pieces of content per month from 4 hubs.**

### Content Pillars (Mapped to Archetype)

| Pillar | Archetype | Content Examples | Ratio |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **The Transformation** | Magician (primary) | POV transitions, Kit reveals, before/after perspective shifts | 40% |
| **The Philosophy** | Sage (secondary) | Movement philosophy, "the other 23 hours" essays, mindful movement guides | 25% |
| **The Community** | Both | UGC, studio features, "What's In My Kit", customer stories | 25% |
| **The Product** | Magician | Kit spotlights, fabric stories, new colorway drops | 10% |

**Note: Product content is only 10%. Intus sells meaning, not merch. The Kit sells itself when the philosophy lands.**

## 3. Platform-Specific Content Formats

### TikTok (5-7 posts/week)

| Format | Hook (First 1.5s) | Structure | Length |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|--------|
| **POV: Transition** | "POV: You stop changing clothes 3 times a day" | Day-in-the-life: studio → coffee → street in one Kit | 15-30s |
| **The Question** | "The activewear question nobody asks" | Text reveal → "What do you wear between workouts?" → Kit reveal | 10-15s |
| **What's In My Kit** | Person holds up Kit pieces | Quick styling + "This is my [Reformer/Street/Recovery] Kit" | 15-20s |
| **Philosophy Drop** | Provocative statement on screen | "Your gym clothes weren't designed for your day" → short essay | 30-60s |
| **Sound trend remix** | Trending audio + Intus-relevant visual | Adapt trending format to transition/Kit narrative | 10-30s |

**TikTok Rules:**
- Hook in first 1.5s (visual change or text)
- Visual change every 3 seconds (3-Second Rule)
- End on payoff, cut immediately (Quit While Ahead)
- No watermarks when reposting to Instagram
- Completion rate > everything else

### Instagram (4-5 posts/week + daily Stories)

| Format | Type | Content |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Reels** | Video (15-60s) | Same as TikTok but re-edited (no TikTok watermark). Transition POVs, Kit styling. |
| **Carousel** | 5-7 slides | "The Philosophy of Intentional Movement" / "5 Signs You're a Hybrid Athlete" / Kit lookbook |
| **Single image** | Lifestyle photo | Transition moment photography (per Deliverable 7 photography direction) |
| **Stories** | Daily | Behind-the-scenes, polls ("Reformer or Street Kit?"), studio partner features, repost UGC |

**Instagram Rules:**
- Saves & Sends are the primary metric (5x more valuable than likes)
- Carousel posts get highest reach for educational content
- Never post a TikTok with watermark
- Stories: use polls/questions for engagement (algorithm signal)

### YouTube (1-2 videos/week)

| Format | Type | Content |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Long-form** (1/month) | 5-10 min | "The Within Story" chapters, Movement Philosophy deep dives |
| **Shorts** (1-2/week) | <60s | Bridge content from TikTok — re-edited, vertical, with end card linking to long-form |

**YouTube Rules:**
- Long-form = trust + search SEO (compounds over time)
- Shorts = discovery (Explore/Exploit algorithm)
- Thumbnail: high contrast, <4 words, mobile-legible, face + emotion
- Title: front-load keyword, <60 characters
- Upload 1-2 hours before peak audience activity

### Email (Klaviyo — 2-3 emails/week)

See Deliverable 12 for full lifecycle system.
