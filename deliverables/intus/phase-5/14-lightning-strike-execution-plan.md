# Lightning Strike Execution Plan — Intus
**Department:** Distribution & Growth Engine
**Phase:** 5A | Launch Kit
**Date:** February 2026

---

## 1. Strike Rationale

"Intentional Movement" is a new category. New categories cannot be built through drip marketing — they require a concentrated awareness push that creates a sense of inevitability. The Lightning Strike compresses maximum impact into a 2-week window.

**Strike = Air Wars (digital reach) + Ground Wars (physical activation)**

## 7. 24-72 Hour Triage Protocol

### Hour 24: First Check

| Signal | Check | Action if Failing |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Ad CTR | >1.5% | Swap thumbnail/hook. Test "The Question" hook if POV is underperforming. |
| Website sessions | Traffic flowing? | Check UTM tracking, pixel firing, ad approval status. |
| Email open rate | >25% | Check subject line, sender name, deliverability. |
| Social engagement | Comments/shares? | Reply to EVERY comment in first hour (Golden Hour). |

### Hour 48: Assessment

| Signal | Check | Action if Failing |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Kit sales velocity | Any purchases? | If zero: check checkout flow, guarantee visibility, pricing display. |
| Kit Quiz completions | 50+ by Day 2? | If low: push quiz link harder in social, add quiz CTA to ad creative. |
| Studio QR scans | Any traffic? | If zero: follow up with studio partners, check QR code placement. |

### Hour 72: Decision Point

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Sales + engagement on track | Maintain plan. Shift budget to highest-performing channel. |
| Engagement high, sales low | Conversion issue. Check: site speed, checkout friction, guarantee visibility. |
| Engagement low, sales low | Content/targeting issue. Test new creative concepts. Expand audience. |
| Studio conversions high, online low | Double down on studio channel. Consider studio-exclusive Kit. |
