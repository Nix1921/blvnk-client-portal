EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis report defines the complete distribution architecture for BLVNK Canvas — channel strategy, content engineering, growth loops, and measurement framework. Every distribution decision is engineered for specific algorithmic behaviors, not sprayed into the void.\n\n**The distribution thesis:** BLVNK Canvas doesn't need thousands of followers. It needs the right 50-200 founders to find, understand, and trust the \"Brand Intelligence Systems\" category within 90 days. This is a precision strike, not a volume play.\n\n**Primary channel:** LinkedIn. One platform, dominated, before any expansion.\n\n**Primary motion:** Content → Category Belief → Booking. Not content → virality → fame.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CHANNEL STRATEGY\n\n### 2.1 Channel Selection Logic\n\n| Channel | Decision | Rationale |\n|---------|----------|-----------|\n| **LinkedIn** | ✅ PRIMARY | B2B lead gen + professional authority. Target audience (founders/CEOs) lives here. \"Golden Hour\" model rewards consistent niche content. First-degree connections drive early distribution |\n| **Website/Blog** | ✅ SECONDARY | SEO/AEO/GEO for search discoverability. LinkedIn content repurposed for long-form assets. Category ownership through `/intelligence` page |\n| **Email** | ✅ TERTIARY | Lifecycle nurture for leads captured via transitional CTAs. Low volume, high relevance |\n| **YouTube** | ❌ NOT NOW | Requires video production infrastructure. Solo operator can't sustain quality long-form. Revisit when revenue supports a content partner |\n| **TikTok/Instagram** | ❌ NOT NOW | Wrong audience (consumer, not B2B founder). Wrong format (visual/lifestyle, not intelligence/insight). Category confusion risk |\n| **X (Twitter)** | ❌ NOT NOW | 6-hour half-life means unsustainable content velocity for a solo operator. Not where the target audience makes buying decisions |\n| **Paid Ads** | ❌ NOT NOW | Organic conversion benchmarks must be established first. \"Fire bullets, then cannonballs\" — validate messaging before spending |\n\n### 2.2 Platform Rule: One Channel, Dominated\n\n**The constraint is the strategy.** Solo operators who spread across 5 platforms produce mediocre content on all 5. BLVNK Canvas will:\n1. Dominate LinkedIn (3-5 posts/week, 90 days)\n2. Repurpose top-performing LinkedIn content to blog (SEO asset building)\n3. Add channels ONLY after LinkedIn generates consistent inbound leads\n\n---\n\n## 3. LINKEDIN STRATEGY — \"LIGHTNING STRIKE\"\n\n### 3.1 The Lightning Strike Framework (From Dept 3)\n\n**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): The Problem**\nEstablish the villain. Make founders recognize the pain.\n\n| Post # | Theme | Format | Hook Pattern |\n|--------|-------|--------|-------------|\n| 1 | \"Your brand strategy is a PDF nobody opens\" | Text, short declarative | Loss aversion — quantify waste |\n| 2 | \"I audited 47 brand decks. 43 hadn't been opened in 6 months.\" | Data point + narrative | Specificity creates credibility |\n| 3 | \"The $50,000 deliverable problem\" | Text, numbered observations | Anchoring — cost of old way |\n| 4 | \"Why your brand strategist gives you a document instead of a system\" | Insight/education | Category contrast (document vs. system) |\n| 5 | \"Three signs your brand strategy is already dead\" | Listicle | Pattern recognition (reader self-diagnoses) |\n\n**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): The Category**\nName and define \"Brand Intelligence Systems.\"\n\n| Post # | Theme | Format | Hook Pattern |\n|--------|-------|--------|-------------|\n| 6 | \"What if your brand strategy could answer back?\" | Question hook | Curiosity gap — introduces BIS concept |\n| 7 | \"Dead deliverables vs. living systems: a side-by-side\" | Comparison (text or carousel) | Before/after framing |\n| 8 | \"The 7 departments that decode a brand\" | Methodology reveal | Process transparency builds authority |\n| 9 | \"Why I stopped calling myself a brand strategist\" | Personal narrative | Authenticity + category repositioning |\n| 10 | \"Brand Intelligence Systems: the category no one's named yet\" | Category declaration | Category creation — claims first-mover |\n\n**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): The Proof**\nShow outcomes. Convert awareness to bookings.\n\n| Post # | Theme | Format | Hook Pattern |\n|--------|-------|--------|-------------|\n| 11 | \"What a Brand Intelligence System actually looks like\" | Visual walkthrough (carousel or screenshots) | Tangibility — show the product |\n| 12 | \"The founder who stopped guessing\" | Case study / before-after | Social proof — transformation story |\n| 13 | Before/after: static deck vs. BIS | Comparison visual | Concrete differentiation |\n| 14 | \"What most branding agencies won't tell you\" | Insider knowledge | Authority through transparency |\n| 15 | \"How to know if you're ready for a BIS\" | Self-qualifying checklist | Pre-qualifies leads, reduces friction |\n\n### 3.2 LinkedIn Content Engineering\n\n**Golden Hour Protocol:**\n- Post between 7:00 AM – 9:00 AM AEST (target audience start-of-day on East Coast AU / evening in US)\n- Reply to EVERY comment within 60 minutes — first-hour engagement determines distribution tier\n- Engagement comments from own network amplify reach to second-degree connections\n\n**Post Format Rules:**\n| Rule | Implementation |\n|------|---------------|\n| Hook (first 2 lines) | Must create a reason to click \"...see more\". Use: specific numbers, counterintuitive claims, or loss-framing |\n| Line breaks | After every 1-2 sentences. Dense paragraphs kill mobile readability |\n| Length sweet spot | 800-1,200 characters (long enough for depth, short enough for complete reads) |\n| CTA style | Soft: \"Agree? Disagree?\" or \"What's your experience?\" — drives comments, not link clicks |\n| Links | NEVER in main post body. LinkedIn penalizes external links 50-90%. Put links in first comment |\n| Hashtags | 3-5 max. Niche over broad: #BrandIntelligence #FounderBranding #BrandStrategy |\n| Visuals | Use branded data graphics (charcoal + white + Signal Blue from Dept 5). NOT stock images |\n\n### 3.3 Profile Optimization\n\n| Element | Specification |\n|---------|--------------|\n| Headline | \"Building Brand Intelligence Systems for founders who are done guessing\" |\n| Banner | Dark charcoal, \"Your brand, decoded.\" in Warm White + Signal Blue accent. BLVNK Canvas wordmark |\n| About | StoryBrand structure: Problem → Solution → Results → CTA. Customer is hero. 2,000 chars max |\n| Featured | Pin top 3 posts from each Lightning Strike phase as they mature |\n| Experience | \"Founder, BLVNK Canvas — Brand Intelligence Systems\" |\n| URL | blvnkcanvas.com (direct link to homepage) |\n\n---\n\n## 4. CONTENT FLYWHEEL (HUB-AND-SPOKE)\n\n### 4.1 The System\n\n```\nHub Asset (Weekly)\n└── LinkedIn post #1 (core insight)\n    ├── LinkedIn post #2 (expanded angle)\n    ├── LinkedIn post #3 (counterpoint or data)\n    ├── Blog article (SEO-optimized long-form)\n    ├── Email newsletter snippet (for subscribed leads)\n    └── LinkedIn carousel (if visual comparison works)\n```\n\n**One idea → 5-6 spokes per week.** This is NOT about creating more content. It's about extracting maximum distribution from ONE idea across formats.\n\n### 4.2 Content Calendar (Week Template)\n\n| Day | Post Type | Purpose |\n|-----|-----------|---------|\n| Monday | Core insight post (text, 800-1,200 chars) | Establish authority on weekly theme |\n| Tuesday | — (engagement: reply to comments, engage with target audience posts) | Build social capital |\n| Wednesday | Data/comparison post (text or carousel) | Provide proof/evidence for Monday's claim |\n| Thursday | — (engagement day) | Direct conversations → DMs → bookings |\n| Friday | Personal narrative or methodology reveal | Build trust through human-behind-the-system |\n\n**Velocity:** 3 posts/week minimum, 5 maximum. Quality > quantity. Every post must advance the category belief.\n\n---\n\n## 5. SEO & AI SEARCH STRATEGY\n\n### 5.1 Search Engine Optimization (Blog)\n\n**Primary strategy:** Repurpose LinkedIn content into long-form blog articles optimized for search.\n\n| Target Keyword | Page | Intent | Priority |\n|---------------|------|--------|----------|\n| \"brand intelligence system\" | `/intelligence` | Category definition (own this term) | #1 |\n| \"brand strategy that works\" | Blog post | Problem-aware search | #2 |\n| \"brand strategy vs brand identity\" | Blog post | Comparison (informational) | #3 |\n| \"brand strategy cost Australia\" | `/pricing` | Transactional | #4 |\n| \"brand launch checklist for startups\" | Blog post | Informational (lead magnet) | #5 |\n\n### 5.2 Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)\n\nPrepare for AI-driven search (Perplexity, Gemini, ChatGPT web browsing):\n\n| Tactic | Implementation |\n|--------|---------------|\n| **LLMS.txt** | Create `/llms.txt` at site root — markdown file describing BLVNK Canvas services, methodology, and category for AI crawlers |\n| **Content chunking** | Every blog post uses clear H2 headings, bulleted lists, and 40-60 word answer paragraphs at the start of each section |\n| **Schema markup** | Organization, Service, FAQPage, and HowTo schema on relevant pages |\n| **Original data** | Create citable statistics from BLVNK's own work (e.g., \"93% of founders report improved clarity after deploying a BIS\") — AI models prioritize original data |\n| **Third-party citations** | Seek mentions on founder blogs, podcast appearances, or community posts — AI models weight third-party references heavily |\n\n### 5.3 Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)\n\n| Question | Concise Answer (40-60 words) | Target Page |\n|----------|------------------------------|-------------|\n| \"What is a brand intelligence system?\" | \"A Brand Intelligence System (BIS) is an interactive, queryable brand platform that replaces static PDF brand strategy decks. It integrates market research, competitive analysis, brand psychology, visual identity, and growth strategy into a living system that evolves with your business.\" | `/intelligence` |\n| \"How much does brand strategy cost?\" | \"Brand strategy services range from $1,500 for focused sprints to $30,000+ for enterprise builds. A comprehensive Brand Intelligence System — including market research, competitive analysis, visual identity, and digital architecture — typically costs $12,000 for a complete 7-department build.\" | `/pricing` |\n\n---\n\n## 6. EMAIL LIFECYCLE SYSTEM\n\n### 6.1 List Building Strategy\n\n**Entry points:**\n1. **Transitional CTA downloads** — \"The Dead Deliverable Audit\" (free checklist on blog posts)\n2. **Intelligence Briefing bookings** — All booking form submissions enter the sequence\n3. **LinkedIn DM conversations** — Manual add (with permission) from qualified conversations\n\n**Anti-pattern:** NEVER buy lists. NEVER gate blog content. NEVER add without explicit opt-in.\n\n### 6.2 Email Sequences\n\n**Sequence 1: Welcome (Triggered by resource download)**\n\n| Email # | Timing | Subject | Content |\n|---------|--------|---------|---------|\n| 1 | Immediate | \"Here's your [resource name]\" | Deliver promised resource.

Link to accept/book |\n\n### 6.3 Email Technical Setup\n\n| Element | Specification |\n|---------|--------------|\n| Platform | ConvertKit (creator tier) or Loops |\n| Authentication | SPF + DKIM + DMARC (p=reject) |\n| Sending domain | Subdomain: `mail.blvnkcanvas.com` |\n| Volume | < 50k/month → shared IP sufficient |\n| Reply address | Personal — `[name]@blvnkcanvas.com` (NEVER \"no-reply\") |\n\n---\n\n## 7.

Creates new category instead ✅\n3. **Dept 3 (Strategy & Psychology):** Lightning Strike framework directly implements the launch strategy defined in Dept 3 ✅\n4. **Dept 4 (Narrative & Verbal Identity):** All post hooks use the voice system (revelatory, precise, controlled confidence). Word banks applied ✅\n5. **Dept 5 (Creative & Visual Arts):** LinkedIn visuals use charcoal + white + Signal Blue palette. No stock photos ✅\n6. **Dept 6 (Digital & Systems):** Website architecture supports the conversion funnel defined here. UTM tracking via Plausible ✅\n\n---\n\n*Report prepared as Department 7 output for the BLVNK Canvas Launch Kit. All 7 departments are now complete. This report completes the strategic framework. Ready for Quality Gate 4 and final compilation.*\n"
