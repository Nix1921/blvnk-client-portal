  "rawMarkdown": "# Quality Gate 1 — Intelligence Phase Review\n## BLVNK Canvas Launch Kit | Feb 12, 2026\n\n**Reports Reviewed:**\n- `outputs/01-market-intelligence-report.md` (Dept 1)\n- `outputs/02-competitive-dynamics-report.md` (Dept 2)\n\n---\n\n## Applicable Checks (Gate 1)\n\n### 1. Strategic Consistency ✅ PASS\n\n| Check | Status | Notes |\n|-------|--------|-------|\n| \"Different vs. Better\" Test | ✅ | Both reports explicitly identify interactive deliverables as DIFFERENT, not just \"better AI.\" Dept 2 reinforces: \"BLVNK is DIFFERENT (deliverable format), not just Better (faster AI)\" |\n| Magic Triangle Alignment | ✅ | Product (interactive deliverables) + Company (systemized methodology) + Category (productized AI brand strategy) are consistent across both reports |\n| Category/Positioning consistent | ✅ | Both reports converge on: \"productized AI brand strategy with interactive deliverables\" as the positioning. No contradictions |\n| No zero-sum thinking | ✅ | Dept 1 identifies market expansion ($30B+ and growing at 20-35% CAGR). Dept 2 confirms Blue Ocean (new value curve, not fighting for existing share) |\n\n### 6. Measurement Integrity ✅ PASS\n\n| Check | Status | Notes |\n|-------|--------|-------|\n| Triangulated measurement | ✅ | Dept 1 Section 9 proposes MMM + MTA + Incrementality framework |\n| Not relying on platform data as truth | ✅ | Framework includes cross-source verification (UTM + GA + NPS + proposal engagement) |\n| nROAS tracked | ⚡ N/A | Pre-launch — no ads running yet. Framework correctly defers to post-launch |\n| KPIs connect to business outcomes | ✅ | Pipeline (leads/month), revenue per package, NPS — not vanity metrics |\n\n### 8. Competitive Robustness ✅ PASS\n\n| Check | Status | Notes |\n|-------|--------|-------|\n| Tremble Test (resilient to competitor errors) | ✅ | Dept 2 addresses: even if competitors stumble into interactive deliverables (3-6 months), BLVNK defends via continuous improvement + accumulated client data |\n| BATNA calculated | ✅ | Dept 2 Section 9.1 explicitly calculates BLVNK's BATNA and client's BATNA |\n| Not competing on price without differentiation | ✅ | Both reports agree: differentiation is on deliverable FORMAT, not production cost. Price war analysis confirms no Prisoner's Dilemma risk |\n| Costly signaling is credible | ✅ | Dept 2 Section 7 proposes 5 costly signals ranked by effectiveness. Self-as-Client-Zero rated ★★★★★ — signal cost (2 weeks execution) is too high for low-quality imitators to fake |\n\n---\n\n## Non-Applicable Checks (Deferred to Later Gates)\n\n| Section | Applies At |\n|---------|-----------|\n| 2. Archetype Alignment | Gate 2 (after Strategy Dept) |\n| 3. Narrative Quality | Gate 3 (after Narrative Dept) |\n| 4. Visual Consistency | Gate 3 (after Creative Dept) |\n| 5. Digital Performance | Gate 4 (after Digital Dept) |\n| 7. Distribution Readiness | Gate 4 (after Distribution Dept) |\n\n---\n\n## Gate 1 Verdict: ✅ PASS — Proceed to Phase 2\n\n**Score: 3/3 applicable sections pass**\n\n**Cross-Report Consistency Check:**\n- Dept 1 and Dept 2 agree on market sizing, competitive landscape, pricing position\n- Dept 1's Blue Ocean finding (interactive deliverables) is validated by Dept 2's game-theoretic analysis\n- No contradictions between reports\n- Cascading recommendations from Dept 1 (Section 10) are addressed in Dept 2\n- Cascading recommendations from Dept 2 (Section 10) are comprehensive and actionable for all downstream departments\n\n**Minor note for downstream awareness:** Dept 1 floated \"Magician + Creator\" as archetype hypothesis. Dept 2 leans toward \"Magician\" based on Stackelberg leader dynamics. The Strategy department should resolve this — it's not a conflict, just a question to settle.\n\n---\n\n*Quality Gate 1 reviewed by Antigravity (Gemini) | Feb 12, 2026*\n"
