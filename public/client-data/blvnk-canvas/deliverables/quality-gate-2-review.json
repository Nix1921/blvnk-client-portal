  "rawMarkdown": "# Quality Gate 2 — Strategy Phase Review\n## BLVNK Canvas Launch Kit | Feb 12, 2026\n\n**Reports Reviewed:**\n- `outputs/01-market-intelligence-report.md` (Dept 1)\n- `outputs/02-competitive-dynamics-report.md` (Dept 2)\n- `outputs/03-strategy-psychology-report.md` (Dept 3)\n\n---\n\n## Applicable Checks (Gate 2)\n\n### 1. Strategic Consistency ✅ PASS\n\n| Check | Status | Notes |\n|-------|--------|-------|\n| \"Different vs. Better\" Test | ✅ | Dept 3 explicitly runs this test (Section 2.1) — all 4 criteria confirm \"Different.\" Category Design path selected over JTBD Innovation. Strategy articulates a new problem (\"dead deliverables\") |\n| Magic Triangle Alignment | ✅ | Product (interactive deliverables) + Company (solo + AI + coalition) + Category (\"Brand Intelligence Systems\") aligned. Section 3.2 provides visual model |\n| Category/Positioning consistent | ✅ | Dept 1 identified Blue Ocean in interactive deliverables. Dept 2 confirmed via game theory. Dept 3 formalizes as \"Brand Intelligence Systems\" category. Consistent escalation across all 3 departments |\n| No zero-sum thinking | ✅ | Category Design is explicitly missionary (expanding market), not mercenary (fighting for share). Category Potential Equation calculates new addressable market of $42.5M |\n\n### 2. Archetype Alignment ✅ PASS (Pre-creative)\n\n| Check | Status | Notes |\n|-------|--------|-------|\n| Single dominant archetype | ✅ | Magician (primary) with Creator (secondary). Clearly defined expression guide |\n| No opposing quadrant clash | ✅ | Magician (Risk/Mastery) + Creator (Stability/Control) = adjacent quadrants. No conflict |\n| Visual matches archetype | ⏳ | Deferred to Gate 3 (Dept 5 not yet complete). Direction provided: \"strategic depth, layered info, dark palettes with illuminated accents\" |\n| Voice dimensions align | ⏳ | Deferred to Gate 3 (Dept 4 not yet complete). Direction provided: reveal hidden patterns (Magician) + precise craft (Creator) |\n| Anti-patterns documented | ✅ | Section 4.3 explicitly lists Sage, Hero, Jester, Innocent as anti-patterns with examples to avoid |\n\n### 6. Measurement Integrity ✅ PASS (Carried from Gate 1)\n\nNo changes. Dept 1's measurement framework still applies.\n\n### 8. Competitive Robustness ✅ PASS\n\n| Check | Status | Notes |\n|-------|--------|-------|\n| Tremble Test | ✅ | Category Design survives competitor errors — even if competitors stumble into \"brand intelligence,\" BLVNK owns the category name and has the deepest methodology encoding |\n| BATNA calculated | ✅ | Carried from Dept 2. Dept 3 adds behavioral layer (Endowment Effect via free Brand Sprint creates switching cost) |\n| Not competing on price | ✅ | Explicitly NOT competing on price. Competing on CATEGORY (different, not better). Pricing psychology positions $12k against $18.5k component value |\n| Signaling credible | ✅ | Dept 3 adds behavioral science layer to Dept 2's costly signaling: System 1 triggers (loss aversion, authority) + System 2 validation (methodology transparency, ROI evidence) |\n\n---\n\n## Cross-Department Consistency Audit\n\n| Check | Dept 1 | Dept 2 | Dept 3 | Consistent? |\n|-------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|\n| Core differentiator | Interactive deliverables | Interactive deliverables as costly signal | Interactive deliverables as Category Design element | ✅ |\n| Target market | AU SMBs, tech-forward founders | Stackelberg leader in narrow Blue Ocean | 5,000 ideal targets in AU Year 1 | ✅ |\n| Pricing position | $1.5k-$12k in freelancer-boutique gap | Decoy architecture recommended | Behavioral economics architecture built | ✅ |\n| Competitive approach | Blue Ocean opportunity | Not a Prisoner's Dilemma | Category Design (missionary, not mercenary) | ✅ |\n| Messaging approach | Avoid leading with AI | Never lead with \"we use AI\" | Lead with category problem (\"dead deliverables\") | ✅ |\n| Archetype direction | Floated Magician + Creator | Leaned Magician (Stackelberg leader) | Formalized Magician primary, Creator secondary | ✅ (resolved) |\n\n---\n\n## Gate 2 Verdict: ✅ PASS — Proceed to Phase 3\n\n**Score: 4/4 applicable sections pass** (Strategic Consistency, Archetype pre-check, Measurement carry-forward, Competitive Robustness)\n\n**Archetype question resolved:** Dept 1 hypothesized Magician + Creator. Dept 2 leaned Magician. Dept 3 formalized Magician (primary) + Creator (secondary) with adjacent quadrant validation. No conflict.\n\n**One strong recommendation for Dept 4:** The POV narrative (Section 3.3) should be translated into 3rd-5th grade reading level. Current draft is written at strategy-consultant grade. The Narrative department must simplify THE LANGUAGE without simplifying THE IDEAS.\n\n---\n\n*Quality Gate 2 reviewed by Antigravity (Gemini) | Feb 12, 2026*\n"
