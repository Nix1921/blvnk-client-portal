Strategic Consistency ✅ PASS\n\n| Check | Status | Notes |\n|-------|--------|-------|\n| \"Different vs. Better\" Test | ✅ | Verbal identity (Dept 4) names a NEW problem (\"dead deliverables\"), not a better solution to an old problem. Visual identity (Dept 5) differentiates through dark mode default — competitors all use white/light |\n| Magic Triangle Alignment | ✅ | Product (interactive BIS) visually expressed as intelligence platform. Company (solo + AI) reflected in precise, systematic design language. Category (\"Brand Intelligence Systems\") reinforced through every naming choice |\n| Category/Positioning consistent | ✅ | All 5 departments reference \"Brand Intelligence Systems\" as the category. No slippage |\n| No zero-sum thinking | ✅ | Manifesto creates a new category villain (\"dead deliverables\"), not competitors |\n\n### 2. Brand Identity Alignment ✅ PASS\n\n| Check | Status | Notes |\n|-------|--------|-------|\n| Single dominant archetype | ✅ | Magician throughout — verbal (revelatory, insight language) and visual (dark palette, illuminated accents, light-in-darkness imagery) |\n| Visual matches archetype | ✅ | Charcoal + illuminated blue = revelation in darkness. Architectural imagery = systematic precision. Exact Magician visual codes confirmed |\n| Voice dimensions align | ✅ | Dept 4 voice (revelatory, precise, controlled confidence) matched by Dept 5 visual (restrained, premium, intelligence-coded). Visual-verbal alignment verified |\n| Anti-patterns documented | ✅ | Both departments explicitly list anti-patterns: no Jester energy (playful), no Hero energy (conquering), no stock photography, no AI imagery, forbidden words list |\n| Photography direction | ✅ | Data visualization, architectural, abstract light — matches intelligence positioning. Explicitly rejects stock photos |\n\n### 3. Visual-Verbal Coherence ✅ PASS (New Check for Gate 3)\n\n| Check | Status | Notes |\n|-------|--------|-------|\n| Tagline works visually | ✅ | \"Your brand, decoded.\" — 3 words, declarative period. Works typographically (Instrument Serif accent or Inter Semibold). Short enough for mobile hero |\n| Color palette matches tone | ✅ | Dark charcoal = controlled confidence (Dept 4 voice). Signal Blue = precision (Creator secondary). Warm White = approachable authority |\n| Typography matches voice | ✅ | Inter (geometric, systematic) = Creator precision. Instrument Serif (editorial, authoritative) = Magician gravitas. Match confirmed |\n| Word bank → Visual vocabulary | ✅ | \"Decode, reveal, intelligence\" (Dept 4) → Dark + illuminated accents (Dept 5). \"Engineered, architected, systematic\" (Dept 4) → Grid system, monospace data font (Dept 5). Word choices map to visual choices |\n\n### 4. Quality Dimensions\n\n| Check | Status | Notes |\n|-------|--------|-------|\n| Copy: Me/You ratio | ✅ | 20-25% brand / 75-80% customer across all templates |\n| Copy: Reading level | ✅ | All content 3rd-5th grade Flesch-Kincaid |\n| Visual: Squint Test | ✅ | Looks like intelligence platform, not creative agency |\n| Visual: Grid integrity | ✅ | 8pt grid. All spacing tokens documented |\n| Visual: Semiotic consistency | ✅ | All 8 visual signs point to \"intelligence + systematic precision\" |\n| Visual: Accessibility | ✅ | Primary text contrast ~14:1 (exceeds WCAG AAA) |\n\n---\n\n## Cross-Department Consistency Audit (All 5 Reports)\n\n| Check | Dept 1 | Dept 2 | Dept 3 | Dept 4 | Dept 5 | Consistent? |\n|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|\n| Core differentiator | Interactive deliverables | Costly signal | Category Design element | \"Strategy that talks back\" | Intelligence platform visual | ✅ |\n| Category name | — (pre-name) | — (pre-name) | \"Brand Intelligence Systems\" | \"Brand Intelligence Systems\" | Visual codes match BIS positioning | ✅ |\n| Archetype | Hypothesized Magician | Leaned Magician | Formalized Magician + Creator | Verbal expression defined | Visual expression defined | ✅ |\n| Competitive approach | Blue Ocean | Not Prisoner's Dilemma | Category Design | Manifesto attacks \"dead deliverables\" | Dark mode differentiates from all-white competitors | ✅ |\n| AI positioning | Don't lead with AI | Never lead with AI | AI enables, not defines | \"AI-powered\" is forbidden word | No tool screenshots, no AI imagery | ✅ |\n| Premium signal | Quiet Luxury | Costly signaling | Loss aversion pricing | Controlled confidence voice | 60%+ whitespace, restrained palette | ✅ |\n\n---\n\n## Gate 3 Verdict: ✅ PASS — Proceed to Phase 4\n\n**Score: All applicable sections pass.** Visual-verbal alignment is strong. All 5 departments maintain strategic consistency. The brand system is now complete enough (strategy + narrative + visual) to build the digital experience.\n\n**Key finding:** The \"never lead with AI\" directive has been maintained across ALL 5 departments — this is the strongest thread of consistency. It started as a competitive dynamics observation (Dept 2) and has cascaded perfectly into forbidden words (Dept 4) and forbidden imagery (Dept 5).\n\n---\n\n*Quality Gate 3 reviewed by Antigravity (Gemini) | Feb 12, 2026*\n"
