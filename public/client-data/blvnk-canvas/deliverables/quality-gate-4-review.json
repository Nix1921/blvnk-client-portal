Strategic Consistency ✅ PASS\n\n| Check | Status | Notes |\n|-------|--------|-------|\n| \"Different vs. Better\" Test | ✅ | Digital architecture (Dept 6) positions website as intelligence platform, not portfolio. Distribution (Dept 7) creates a NEW category term (\"Brand Intelligence Systems\"), not better content about existing services |\n| Magic Triangle Alignment | ✅ | Product (BIS), Company (solo + AI), Category (Brand Intelligence Systems) — all three reflected in site IA, content strategy, and pricing architecture |\n| Category consistency | ✅ | \"Brand Intelligence Systems\" referenced 7/7 departments |\n| No zero-sum thinking | ✅ | Content strategy attacks the villain (dead deliverables), never competitors |\n\n### 2. Digital Experience Audit ✅ PASS\n\n| Check | Status | Notes |\n|-------|--------|-------|\n| Scanning patterns | ✅ | Z-Pattern for hero/landing (visual), F-Pattern for content sections, Layer-Cake for methodology. All documented with wireframe rationale |\n| Cognitive load management | ✅ | Progressive disclosure throughout. No walls of text. 5-second test addressed |\n| Conversion architecture | ✅ | 2-click max to booking. CTAs placed mid-scroll (after value established). Pricing uses anchoring + decoy from Dept 3 |\n| Performance targets | ✅ | Sub-1.5s LCP (typography-first hero). ≤500KB page weight. No framework overhead |\n| Accessibility | ✅ | WCAG AAA for primary text (~14:1 contrast). AA for interactive elements. Reduced motion support. ARIA roles planned |\n| Mobile-first | ✅ | Single-column mobile default. Thumb zone CTAs. Full-width buttons. Responsive breakpoints documented |\n\n### 3. Distribution Robustness ✅ PASS\n\n| Check | Status | Notes |\n|-------|--------|-------|\n| Algorithm alignment | ✅ | LinkedIn Golden Hour protocol. Platform-native formatting (no external links in post body). Engagement-first, not reach-first |\n| Content strategy | ✅ | Hub-and-Spoke flywheel (1 idea → 5-6 pieces). Lightning Strike 15-post calendar. NOT random content |\n| Search readiness | ✅ | SEO + AEO (40-60 word answers) + GEO (LLMS.txt, schema, original data) — covers all three search modes |\n| Email compliance | ✅ | SPF + DKIM + DMARC (p=reject). No bought lists. 5-email max sequence. Personal reply address |\n| Metrics integrity | ✅ | Revenue-centric hierarchy (revenue → proposals → briefings → traffic → engagement). Anti-vanity framework. No blended CAC |\n\n### 4. Cross-Department Consistency (All 7 Reports)\n\n| Thread | Dept 1 | Dept 2 | Dept 3 | Dept 4 | Dept 5 | Dept 6 | Dept 7 | Consistent? |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|\n| Category: \"Brand Intelligence Systems\" | — | — | Named | Used | Visualized | Architectured | Distributed | ✅ |\n| Archetype: Magician + Creator | Hypothesized | Leaned | Formalized | Verbalized | Visualized | UX-expressed | Content-expressed | ✅ |\n| Villain: \"Dead deliverable\" | Gap identified | Costly signal contrast | Named & attacked | Manifesto villain | Imagery contrast | Section 2 of homepage | Post #1 hook | ✅ |\n| \"Never lead with AI\" | Don't lead | Never lead | Strategic principle | Forbidden word | Forbidden imagery | No tool screenshots | No AI-forward content | ✅ |\n| Premium positioning | Blue Ocean market | Quiet luxury codes | Loss aversion pricing | Controlled confidence voice | 60%+ whitespace | Ritualistic friction | Organic-first (no cheap ads) | ✅ |\n| Target audience: Founders/CEOs | Market sizing | Competitive landscape | JTBD/FROTOS | Me/You ratio | Semiotic targeting | Cognitive profile mapped | LinkedIn targeting + content | ✅ |\n\n### 5. Final Quality Dimensions\n\n| Dimension | Status | Evidence |\n|-----------|--------|----------|\n| Strategy | ✅ | Category Design approach consistent. Magic Triangle aligned |\n| Psychology | ✅ | Loss aversion, anchoring, decoy, cognitive fluency — all applied to pricing, copy, and UX |\n| Narrative | ✅ | Customer is Hero. Brand is Guide. Me/You ratio maintained. Reading level 3rd-5th grade |\n| Visual | ✅ | All 8 semiotic signs consistent. Squint test passes. Grid integrity maintained |\n| Digital | ✅ | Performance budgets set. Conversion architecture designed. Accessibility planned |\n| Distribution | ✅ | Platform-native, algorithm-aware, metrics-honest |\n| Economics | ✅ | Unit economics modeled. CAC guardrails. K-Factor tracking. Revenue > vanity |\n\n---\n\n## Gate 4 Verdict: ✅ PASS — All 7 Departments Complete\n\n**All 4 quality gates passed.** The BLVNK Canvas Launch Kit is strategically complete.\n\n**Strongest threads across all 7 departments:**\n1. **\"Never lead with AI\"** — maintained from Dept 2 through Dept 7 without a single break\n2. **\"Brand Intelligence Systems\" category** — named in Dept 3, then visualized, architectured, and distributed consistently\n3. **Customer as Hero** — never violated. All copy, UX, and content positions the founder as the protagonist\n\n**Ready for Phase 5:** Final compilation into the unified Brand Intelligence System deliverable.\n\n---\n\n*Quality Gate 4 reviewed by Antigravity (Gemini) | Feb 12, 2026*\n"
