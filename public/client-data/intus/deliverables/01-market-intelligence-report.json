  "rawMarkdown": "# Market Intelligence Report — Intus\n**Department:** Market Intelligence & Analytics\n**Phase:** 1A | Launch Kit\n**Date:** February 2026\n\n---\n\n## 1. Strategic Objective (First Questions)\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Why?** | Full brand launch — establish defensible market position for early-stage DTC activewear brand |\n| **Scope** | Australian activewear market (primary), US expansion (secondary). Women's + Men's apparel. |\n| **Competitors** | Direct: LSKD, Echt, STAX, Lorna Jane, Elite Eleven. Global benchmarks: Gymshark, Vuori, Alo Yoga. Niche: Flexlara, Nimble, P.E Nation. |\n| **Data** | Aggregated market reports, competitor website data, consumer surveys, industry trend reports (AUSactive 2025-26). No user-level data yet (pre-launch stage). |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Market Sizing & Segmentation\n\n### 2.1 Total Addressable Market\n\n| Metric | Value | Source |\n|--------|-------|--------|\n| Australian activewear market (2025) | USD $8.7 billion | Industry report |\n| Projected market (2034) | USD $13.2 billion | CAGR 4.63% |\n| Fitness & athletic clothing stores (2024) | AUD $4.2 billion | Market analysis |\n| GDP contribution (2024) | AUD $1.52 billion | Economic data |\n\n### 2.2 Category Breakdown\n\n| Segment | Share | Revenue |\n|---------|-------|---------|\n| Sports Apparel | 55% | $2.3 billion |\n| Footwear | 37% | $1.5 billion |\n| Accessories | 7.5% | $308.6 million |\n\n### 2.3 Intus Serviceable Market\n\nIntus operates in Sports Apparel only (no footwear). Within that $2.3B segment:\n- **Mid-range DTC activewear** (price point $45-$115 AUD): Estimated 25-30% of apparel segment = ~$575M-$690M\n- **Target demo (18-35, dual gender, metro AU)**: Further narrows to ~$200M-$250M serviceable addressable market\n- **Realistic early-stage capture**: At <$100K revenue, Intus holds <0.05% of serviceable market\n\n### 2.4 Growth Drivers\n\n1. **Athleisure fusion** — sport and fashion convergence continuing post-pandemic\n2. **Men's activewear growth** — segment expanding faster than women's, less saturated\n3. **Pilates surge** — #2 fitness trend nationally (AUSactive 2025-26), aligns with Intus's \"Hybrid Athlete\"\n4. **Exercise for mental health** — #3 trend, resonates with \"inner power\" brand philosophy\n5. **BNPL adoption** — 18-35 demographic heavily uses Afterpay/Klarna for fashion purchases\n\n---\n\n## 3. Competitive Gap Analysis\n\n### 3.1 Assess — Rival Identification\n\n**Tier 1: Direct Domestic Rivals**\n\n| Brand | Revenue/Scale | Positioning | Price Tier | Moat |\n|-------|--------------|-------------|------------|------|\n| **LSKD** | High growth, major athlete program | Sport x Street, \"1% Better\" | Mid-High ($80 leggings) | Community + action-sport aesthetic |\n| **Echt** | High volume, discount-driven | Athletic aesthetic, frequent drops | Mid ($75-95, aggressive bundles) | Variety + promotional mechanics |\n| **STAX** | Premium, viral marketing | Fashion-forward, inclusive | Premium | \"Airlyte\" proprietary fabric, XXS-4XL |\n| **Lorna Jane** | $166M revenue (2024), ~100 stores | Legacy leader, \"Active Living\" | Premium ($99.99 leggings) | Physical retail + LJ Excel™ fabric |\n| **Elite Eleven** | 82% YoY growth, 240% POS growth | Sport & Lifestyle hybrid | Accessible/Mid | Omnichannel (physical + digital) |\n\n**Tier 2: Global Benchmarks**\n\n| Brand | Positioning | Price Tier | Moat |\n|-------|-------------|------------|------|\n| **Gymshark** | Global gym culture, \"United We Sweat\" | Mid ($60 USD leggings) | Massive community, lifting-specific |\n| **Vuori** | Coastal California lifestyle | Premium ($118 USD joggers) | DreamKnit™, BlissBlend™ |\n| **Alo Yoga** | Studio-to-street luxury wellness | Luxury | Celebrity + lifestyle expansion |\n\n**Tier 3: Niche / Emerging Disruptors**\n\n| Brand | Threat | Why It Matters |\n|-------|--------|----------------|\n| **Flexlara** | High | Undercuts on price ($39 leggings), beats on transparency (19c cost-per-wear), 64% reorder rate |\n| **Nimble** | Medium | MoveLite recycled fabric, Bondi cred, sustainability-first |\n| **Shein/Temu** | Volume threat | Ultra-cheap imports, low trust but high volume capture |\n\n### 3.2 Benchmark — Deep Comparison (Top 5 Direct)\n\n| Dimension | Intus | LSKD | Echt | STAX | Lorna Jane |\n|-----------|-------|------|------|------|------------|\n| **Avg legging price** | $70 | $80 | $75 (bundle: 2/$130) | Premium | $99.99 |\n| **Bundling** | Look bundles ($100 sets) | Volume (2-for deals) | Volume (3-for/$120) | Minimal | Spend-and-save ($200+) |\n| **Proprietary fabric** | None | None specific | None specific | Airlyte™ | LJ Excel™ |\n| **Physical retail** | None (DTC only) | Expanding | Limited | Limited | ~100 stores |\n| **Sustainability** | \"Eco Friendly\" filter | Limited | Limited | Limited | Limited |\n| **Men's range** | Yes (growing) | Yes (strong) | Yes | Yes | No |\n| **US shipping** | Yes (>$200 free) | Yes | Yes | **No** | Yes |\n| **BNPL** | 4 providers | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| **Community mechanic** | #itsallyou UGC | \"Chase the Vibe\" | Drops/sales | Viral/influencer | \"Move Nourish Believe\" |\n\n### 3.3 Strategize — Gap Identification\n\n**Product Gap:** No proprietary fabric technology. Every mid-to-premium competitor has branded fabric or is developing one. Intus's \"buttery, soft comfort\" is indistinguishable from fast fashion copy.\n\n**Service Gap:** 30-day return policy vs. Flexlara's 30-day change-of-mind even after washing. Consumer research shows 92% peace-of-mind at 60-day return policies.\n\n**Positioning Gap:** Currently \"Better\" (softer, cheaper Vuori) but not \"Different.\" No category ownership. No unique vocabulary. The \"Within\" brand meaning is powerful but invisible in marketing.\n\n**Distribution Gap:** DTC-only in a market moving to omnichannel. Elite Eleven proved physical retail lifts online revenue by 50%. Intus has zero physical touchpoints.\n\n**Efficiency Gap:** Bundling strategy is different (look bundles vs. volume bundles) but isn't positioned as a distinct identity — it's just a discount mechanic.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Porter's Five Forces\n\n### Threat of New Entry: HIGH\n\n| Factor | Assessment |\n|--------|-----------|\n| Capital requirements | Low — Shopify + dropship/print-on-demand accessible |\n| Brand loyalty barriers | Medium — established community brands (LSKD, Gymshark) have loyalty |\n| Distribution access | Low barrier — DTC removes gatekeepers |\n| Economies of scale | Advantage to large players (container costs $3K→$14K favor scale) |\n| Regulatory/IP barriers | Low — no patents on most activewear designs |\n\n**Implication:** Easy to enter, hard to sustain. Hundreds of micro-brands launch annually. Differentiation is the only survival mechanism.\n\n### Buyer Power: HIGH\n\n| Factor | Assessment |\n|--------|-----------|\n| Switching costs | Near-zero — no lock-in for activewear |\n| Price sensitivity | High — BNPL adoption, price-tier navigation, bundle mechanics all indicate price-conscious buyers |\n| Information availability | High — reviews, UGC, comparison content abundant |\n| Alternative options | Abundant — 20+ AU brands plus global players |\n\n**Implication:** Buyers have total power. Must create emotional switching costs (community, identity) since product switching costs are zero.\n\n### Supplier Power: MODERATE\n\n| Factor | Assessment |\n|--------|-----------|\n| Fabric suppliers | Concentrated — limited premium textile manufacturers |\n| Manufacturing | Moderate — most AU brands use Asian manufacturing |\n| Proprietary materials | Increasing — brands developing exclusive fabrics raise supplier dependency |\n| Container shipping costs | Rising — $3K to $14K, favoring established relationships |\n\n**Implication:** No immediate supplier crisis, but brands without proprietary fabric partnerships are at the mercy of commodity pricing.\n\n### Threat of Substitutes: MODERATE-HIGH\n\n| Substitute | Threat Level |\n|------------|-------------|\n| Fast fashion activewear (Shein, Temu, Cotton On Body) | High volume, low trust |\n| Luxury athleisure (Alo Yoga, Lululemon) | Trade-up risk for aspirational buyers |\n| Non-branded workout clothing | Commodity threat |\n| Vintage/secondhand activewear | Growing sustainability trend |\n\n**Implication:** The mid-range is a squeeze zone — pressure from below (ultra-cheap) and above (premium lifestyle). Must escape the middle through identity, not price.\n\n### Competitive Rivalry: VERY HIGH\n\n| Factor | Assessment |\n|--------|-----------|\n| Number of competitors | 20+ documented brands in AU market alone |\n| Market growth | 4.63% CAGR — growing but not explosive |\n| Product differentiation | Low to moderate — most compete on fabric feel + aesthetic |\n| Exit barriers | Low for digital-only brands |\n| Strategic stakes | High — athleisure is a lifestyle category, not just apparel |\n\n**Implication:** Crowded, rivalrous market. Current competition is predominantly a Red Ocean — brands fighting over the same \"soft, stylish, affordable\" positioning.\n\n### Five Forces Summary\n\n| Force | Rating | Strategic Response |\n|-------|--------|--------------------|\n| New Entry Threat | HIGH | Build community moat, brand identity as barrier |\n| Buyer Power | HIGH | Create emotional switching costs via identity + community |\n| Supplier Power | MODERATE | Develop proprietary fabric partnership long-term |\n| Substitute Threat | MOD-HIGH | Escape the mid-range squeeze through category design |\n| Competitive Rivalry | VERY HIGH | Stop competing on \"Better\" — need \"Different\" |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Perceptual Mapping + Whitespace\n\n### Axis: Price (Low → High) vs. Identity (Performance → Lifestyle)\n\n```\n                    LIFESTYLE\n                       |\n            Vuori ●    |    ● Alo Yoga\n                       |\n         Intus ○       |       ● P.E Nation\n                       |\n    Echt ●    LSKD ●   |   ● STAX\n                       |\n         Flexlara ●    |       ● Lorna Jane\n                       |\n                    PERFORMANCE\n         ──────────────┼──────────────\n              LOW      |      HIGH\n                     PRICE\n```\n\n### Whitespace Identified\n\n1. **\"Intentional Movement\" territory** — Between lifestyle and performance, at mid-price. No brand owns the intersection of mindful training + everyday wear with a philosophical foundation. Intus's \"Within\" positioning could claim this space.\n\n2. **Men's lifestyle activewear at mid-price** — Gymshark owns \"gym-bro,\" Vuori owns \"premium coastal.\" The Melbourne-based, minimal, everyday male athleisure shopper is underserved.\n\n3. **Transparency + mid-price** — Flexlara owns transparency at budget. No mid-price brand has made supply-chain transparency a core identity element.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Brand Health Baseline\n\n### Current State (Pre-Launch Measurement)\n\n| Metric | Current Estimate | Target (Post-Launch) | Method |\n|--------|-----------------|---------------------|--------|\n| **BAI (Brand Awareness Index)** | ~2-5% (niche awareness in Melbourne fitness community) | 15-20% in target demo | Survey: unaided + aided recall |\n| **SOV (Share of Voice)** | <1% of category conversation | 3-5% in target demo | Social listening + Share of Search |\n| **NSS (Net Sentiment Score)** | Insufficient data (low volume) | >60 | NLP sentiment analysis |\n| **NPS (Net Promoter Score)** | Not yet measurable | >40 | Post-purchase survey |\n| **Share of Search** | Negligible | 2-3% of category searches | Google Trends + SEMrush |\n\n**Note:** Intus is pre-scale. These baselines serve as the \"zero point\" against which all launch kit activities will be measured.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Customer Journey Mapping\n\n### The Hybrid Athlete Journey\n\n**Stage 1: Awareness**\n- **Touchpoints:** TikTok/Instagram discovery (video-first), UGC via #itsallyou, word-of-mouth in fitness communities\n- **Barrier:** Low brand awareness. Competing against algorithm-favored established brands.\n- **Current gap:** No paid media strategy. Organic only.\n\n**Stage 2: Interest**\n- **Touchpoints:** Website visit, product browsing, price-tier navigation (Under $40/$60)\n- **Barrier:** Generic product descriptions don't differentiate from fast fashion screenshots\n- **Current gap:** \"Buttery, soft comfort\" = same language as every competitor\n\n**Stage 3: Consideration**\n- **Touchpoints:** Bundle comparison, BNPL calculation, sizing/fit evaluation\n- **Barrier:** No physical retail to touch/feel. 30-day return policy lags market (should be 60+)\n- **Current gap:** Trust gap — digital-only brand with no reviews ecosystem at scale\n\n**Stage 4: Conversion**\n- **Touchpoints:** Cart, checkout, BNPL selection, free shipping threshold ($150)\n- **Barrier:** $150 free shipping threshold may be too high for first-time buyers\n- **Current gap:** No first-purchase incentive beyond bundles\n\n**Stage 5: Retention**\n- **Touchpoints:** Email/SMS lifecycle, reorder prompts, community engagement\n- **Barrier:** No loyalty program, no proprietary product experience that creates dependency\n- **Current gap:** Email/SMS exists but no documented lifecycle system\n\n**Stage 6: Advocacy**\n- **Touchpoints:** #itsallyou UGC, referral, reviews\n- **Barrier:** Small community = low UGC volume\n- **Current gap:** Hashtag exists but not amplified into a systematic advocacy engine\n\n---\n\n## 8. Measurement Framework Design (Triangulated)\n\n### For an Early-Stage DTC Brand\n\nGiven Intus's stage (pre-scale, <$100K, digital-only), the full MMM/MTA/Incrementality framework needs to be adapted:\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation Metrics (Now → Month 3)\n\n| Layer | Metric | Tool | Why |\n|-------|--------|------|-----|\n| **Acquisition** | CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) | Shopify + UTM tracking | Know what each customer costs |\n| **Acquisition** | nROAS (New Customer ROAS) | First-party attribution | Separate new vs. returning revenue |\n| **Revenue** | AOV (Average Order Value) | Shopify analytics | Track bundle effectiveness |\n| **Revenue** | MER (Marketing Efficiency Ratio) | Total Revenue / Total Ad Spend | Holistic efficiency view |\n| **Retention** | Repeat Purchase Rate | Shopify + Klaviyo | Baseline loyalty |\n| **Retention** | 90-Day Reorder Rate | Cohort analysis | Compare against Flexlara's 64% benchmark |\n| **Brand** | Share of Search | Google Trends + SEMrush | Track branded search growth |\n| **Brand** | Social SOV | Social listening tool | Track conversation share |\n\n### Phase 2: Attribution Layer (Month 3 → Month 6)\n\n| Method | Application | Requirement |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| **First-party tracking** | Server-side events via Shopify + CAPI | Engineering setup |\n| **UTM discipline** | Standardized, lowercase UTM taxonomy | Marketing ops |\n| **Lookback windows** | 60-day minimum for activewear consideration cycle | Platform configuration |\n| **C+DV for video** | Clicks + Deterministic Views for TikTok/YouTube | Video-first channel strategy |\n\n### Phase 3: Triangulation (Month 6+, when data matures)\n\n| Method | Purpose | Data Requirement |\n|--------|---------|-----------------|\n| **Simplified MMM** | Channel-level budget allocation | 6+ months of spend + revenue data |\n| **MTA (Time Decay)** | Short sales cycle attribution | User-level tracking |\n| **Geo-lift testing** | Causal validation of ad spend | Sufficient volume for geo splits |\n\n### KPI Targets (First 90 Days Post-Launch)\n\n| Metric | Target | Rationale |\n|--------|--------|-----------|\n| CAC | <$45 AUD | Must be <50% of AOV to be sustainable |\n| AOV | >$95 AUD | Bundle strategy should push above single-item average |\n| MER | >3.0x | Early-stage benchmark (5.0x is mature brand target) |\n| Repeat Purchase Rate | >15% within 90 days | Baseline for retention health |\n| Share of Search | >0.5% of category | Measurable awareness signal |\n| Email List | >2,000 subscribers | Foundation for lifecycle marketing |\n| NPS | >30 (first cohort) | Minimum viable loyalty signal |\n\n### Red Flags to Monitor\n\n- Blended ROAS used for scaling decisions (must track nROAS separately)\n- Platform-reported conversions without server-side verification\n- High CAC with low repeat rate = leaky bucket\n- Bundle discounts eroding margin without increasing LTV\n\n---\n\n## 9. Key Findings & Strategic Implications\n\n### The Three Truths\n\n1. **The market is growing but crowded.** $8.7B → $13.2B growth is real, but 20+ brands are fighting for the same \"soft, stylish, affordable\" positioning. Growth alone won't save an undifferentiated brand.\n\n2. **Mid-range is a squeeze zone.** Pressure from ultra-cheap (Shein/Temu) and premium aspirational (Vuori/Alo). Brands that stay in the \"better version of the same thing\" middle get compressed.\n\n3. **Identity is the only moat.** At Intus's stage, they can't out-spend (Lorna Jane), out-distribute (Elite Eleven), or out-tech (STAX/Vuori). The \"Within\" philosophy is the only asset that can't be copied — but it's currently invisible.\n\n### Recommendations for Downstream Departments\n\n| Department | Key Input from Intelligence |\n|------------|----------------------------|\n| **Competitive Dynamics** | Market is Red Ocean. Pricing dynamics follow Prisoner's Dilemma (bundle wars). Need game-changing move, not incremental competition. STAX doesn't ship to US — exploit this gap. |\n| **Strategy & Psychology** | \"Different vs. Better\" audit is critical. Current positioning = \"Better\" (softer, cheaper Vuori). Must find \"Different\" through category design or JTBD reframe. |\n| **Narrative & Verbal Identity** | Current vocabulary is generic category clichés. \"Within\" brand story is the #1 untapped asset. Customer language needs complete overhaul. |\n| **Creative & Visual** | Perceptual map shows whitespace in \"Intentional Movement\" territory. Visual identity should reflect philosophical depth, not just \"clean minimal activewear.\" |\n| **Digital & Systems** | Shopify DTC is the entire brand experience. Trust gap means website must overcompensate — reviews, sizing tools, return policy upgrade (30→60 days). |\n| **Distribution & Growth** | Video-first channels active but strategy unclear. Email lifecycle critical for retention given zero physical touchpoints. Pop-up strategy could close trust gap. |\n\n---\n\n*Deliverable 1 of 16 — Intus Launch Kit*\n*Next: Competitive Dynamics Model & Strategy (Phase 1B)*\n"
