  "rawMarkdown": "# Strategic Positioning Brief & Category Blueprint — Intus\n**Department:** Strategy & Psychology Lab\n**Phase:** 2A | Launch Kit\n**Date:** February 2026\n\n---\n\n## 1. \"Different vs. Better\" Audit\n\n### Current State: Competing on \"Better\"\n\nIntus currently operates within the existing activewear frame — \"soft, stylish, affordable\" — and attempts to be a *better* version of what already exists. This is a losing position.\n\n| Dimension | Intus (Current) | Competitor Default | Verdict |\n|-----------|----------------|-------------------|---------|\n| Fabric | \"Buttery, soft comfort\" | \"DreamKnit\", \"Airlyte\", \"Peach Perfect\" | **Same frame** — Intus uses generic descriptors while competitors own proprietary names |\n| Pricing | Bundle & Save ($100 sets) | 2-for deals, volume bundles, constant sales | **Same frame** — both use discount mechanics to drive AOV |\n| Aesthetic | \"Clean, elevated essentials\" | \"Minimal\", \"premium\", \"elevated\" | **Same frame** — every mid-range brand claims this |\n| Community | #itsallyou | \"1% Better Every Day\" (LSKD), \"Active Living\" (Lorna Jane) | **Same frame** — hashtag without costly signal |\n| Sustainability | \"Eco Friendly\" filter on site | Recycled polyester, B Corp, carbon neutral | **Same frame** — sustainability as footnote, not headline |\n\n### Required Shift: From \"Better\" to \"Different\"\n\nThe Phase 1 competitive analysis confirmed: Intus cannot out-spend, out-distribute, or out-tech its competitors. The only viable path is to **reframe what the competition is about**.\n\n**The reframe:** Stop competing on *what activewear is made of* and start competing on *what movement means*.\n\n| \"Better\" (Current Frame) | \"Different\" (New Frame) |\n|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| \"Our fabric is softer\" | \"We believe movement has meaning\" |\n| \"Our bundles save you money\" | \"The Kit is your daily uniform for intentional living\" |\n| \"We're like Gymshark but cleaner\" | \"We're the brand for people who move with purpose\" |\n| \"Activewear for the gym\" | \"Essentials for the Hybrid Athlete's entire day\" |\n\n**Verdict: DIFFERENT path confirmed. Category Design is the strategic fork.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Strategic Fork: Category Design\n\n### Why Category Design (Not JTBD)\n\n| Criteria | Category Design | JTBD | Intus Fit |\n|----------|----------------|------|-----------|\n| Market state | Create new space | Serve existing needs better | Intus needs new space — \"better activewear\" is a Red Ocean |\n| Customer language | Doesn't exist yet | Customers can articulate it | Customers don't have words for \"intentional movement\" yet |\n| Competitive response | Hard to follow (category queen advantage) | Easy to copy (feature parity) | Intus needs a position competitors can't copy |\n| Brand name alignment | \"Intus\" = Latin for \"within\" = perfect category vessel | Name is irrelevant to job | The name IS the category |\n| Revenue ceiling | Category queens capture 76% of category economics | Incremental share gains | Intus needs disproportionate capture, not incremental share |\n\n**Decision: Category Design. Intus will design and own the \"Intentional Movement\" category.**\n\n### The Category: Intentional Movement\n\n**Category Definition:** Intentional Movement is the practice of moving through your entire day — gym, studio, commute, social — with awareness and purpose. It rejects the binary of \"workout clothes\" vs. \"real clothes\" and the hustle-culture framing of \"no days off.\" Intentional Movement says: every movement counts, not just the ones that make you sweat.\n\n**Category Name Candidates:**\n\n| Option | Strengths | Weaknesses | Recommendation |\n|--------|-----------|------------|----------------|\n| \"Intentional Movement\" | Descriptive, philosophical depth, aligns with \"Within\" | Slightly long, may need shortening for hashtags | **PRIMARY** |\n| \"Movement Philosophy\" | Academic gravitas, content-rich | Could feel pretentious for mid-range brand | Secondary / content pillar name |\n| \"Everyday Movement\" | Accessible, clear | Generic, lacks philosophical weight | Reject |\n\n**The Word Intus Owns:** \"Intentional\"\n\nEvery category queen owns a word. Volvo owns \"safety.\" Patagonia owns \"environment.\" **Intus owns \"intentional.\"** This word connects:\n- \"Intentional Movement\" (the category)\n- \"Intentional design\" (the product philosophy)\n- \"Intentional living\" (the customer aspiration)\n- \"Intus\" / \"Within\" (the brand origin — intention starts within)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Category Blueprint\n\n### The Ecosystem Map\n\n```\n                    INTENTIONAL MOVEMENT\n                           |\n            +--------------+--------------+\n            |              |              |\n        THE PRACTICE   THE PRODUCT    THE COMMUNITY\n            |              |              |\n    +-------+-------+  +--+--+    +------+------+\n    |       |       |  |     |    |      |      |\n  Studio  Street  Rest Kit  Layers  Studios  Clubs  Digital\n  Movement Movement     Singles       Partners  Content\n```\n\n**THE PRACTICE** — What Intentional Movement looks like:\n- **Studio Movement:** Reformer Pilates, yoga, functional training (high-awareness exercise)\n- **Street Movement:** Walking, running, cycling to/from places (movement as transport, not just exercise)\n- **Rest as Movement:** Recovery, stretching, mindful stillness (intentional non-movement)\n\n**THE PRODUCT** — What Intus makes for Intentional Movers:\n- **The Kit:** Curated daily uniform (top + bottom as identity set, not discount bundle)\n- **Layers:** Outerwear and transition pieces for between-movement states\n- **Singles:** Individual pieces that integrate into The Kit ecosystem\n\n**THE COMMUNITY** — Where Intentional Movers gather:\n- **Studio Partners:** Reformer Pilates studios (priority coalition from Phase 1B)\n- **Movement Clubs:** Melbourne run clubs, walking groups, outdoor fitness\n- **Digital Content:** Movement philosophy content (education, not product showcases)\n\n### Category Potential (CP)\n\n**CP = People with the problem x Price willing to pay**\n\n- Addressable population: The \"Hybrid Athlete\" segment in Australia = ~2.4M consumers (18-35, metro, fitness-active, dual gender)\n- Problem prevalence: ~60% feel their activewear doesn't represent their full lifestyle (gym-only framing)\n- Price willingness: Mid-range sweet spot ($45-$115 AUD per item, $100-$200 per Kit)\n- **CP = 1.44M x $150 avg Kit = ~$216M addressable category value**\n\nThis aligns with the Phase 1A serviceable market estimate of $200-250M.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Positioning Architecture\n\n### The Positioning Statement\n\n**For** the Hybrid Athlete who moves between studio, street, and social life,\n**Intus** is the **Intentional Movement brand** that\n**provides** curated daily uniforms (\"The Kit\") designed for how you actually live,\n**unlike** traditional activewear brands that optimize for the gym and treat everything else as an afterthought,\n**because** Intus believes every movement has meaning — and what you wear should reflect that intention.\n\n### The POV (Point of View)\n\nEvery activewear brand asks: \"What do you do when you work out?\"\n\nIntus asks: **\"What do you do between workouts?\"**\n\nThat question changes everything. Because the Hybrid Athlete doesn't segment their day into \"gym time\" and \"real life.\" They move through reformer class, coffee with friends, a walking meeting, grocery shopping, and evening stretching — all as one continuous flow. Their clothes should work the same way.\n\nTraditional activewear is designed for the 60-minute window. Intus is designed for the other 23 hours.\n\n### Problem → Solution → Outcome\n\n| Layer | Traditional Frame | Intus Frame |\n|-------|------------------|-------------|\n| **Problem** | \"I need clothes for the gym\" | \"I need clothes that move with me all day\" |\n| **Solution** | Performance fabrics, gym-optimized fit | Curated Kits for the full-day Hybrid Athlete |\n| **Outcome** | \"I look good at the gym\" | \"I move through my day with intention and confidence\" |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Behavioral Economics Execution Layer\n\n### 5.1 Anchoring Strategy\n\n**The Kit as Anchor:** Launch \"The Kit\" at $100 AUD. This becomes the reference price for the Intus ecosystem.\n- Individual pieces (Tank $45, Shorts $55 = $100 separately) are priced to make The Kit feel like the natural choice\n- This is NOT a discount. The Kit IS the product. Individual pieces are the unbundled version.\n\n**Reframe:** \"The Kit for $100\" (identity framing) vs. \"Tank + Shorts for $100\" (discount framing). Same price, different psychology.\n\n### 5.2 Loss Aversion Deployment\n\n**60-Day Return Policy** (recommended in Phase 1B as costly signal):\n- Frame: \"Try The Kit for 60 days. If it doesn't change how you move, send it back.\"\n- Psychology: Once customers have worn The Kit for 60 days, loss aversion kicks in — returning it means *losing* their daily uniform\n- Competitors with 30-day policies can't match this without absorbing higher return costs\n- Expected return rate: <8% (Flexlara's 64% 90-day reorder rate suggests high satisfaction in this category)\n\n### 5.3 Sunk Cost & Identity Lock-In\n\n**\"The Kit\" Collection Strategy:**\n- Season 1: Launch with 3 Kit combinations (Reformer Kit, Street Kit, Recovery Kit)\n- Season 2: Introduce Kit extensions (add a Layer piece to existing Kit)\n- Season 3: Kit evolution (updated colorways that complement previous Kits)\n- Psychology: Each Kit purchase increases identity investment. Customers who own 2+ Kits are buying into the Intentional Movement lifestyle, not just clothes.\n\n### 5.4 Social Proof Architecture\n\n| Signal Type | Mechanism | Deployment |\n|-------------|-----------|------------|\n| **Community Volume** | \"X Kits claimed this week\" (real-time counter) | Product pages, checkout |\n| **Authority** | Pilates studio partnerships (instructor endorsement) | Studio presence, Instagram co-content |\n| **Conformity** | \"What's in my Kit\" UGC content format | TikTok/Instagram format, #MyIntusKit |\n| **Scarcity** | Seasonal Kit colorways (limited, not artificial) | Quarterly drops, genuine limited runs |\n\n### 5.5 Mental Accounting\n\nPosition The Kit in the \"daily essentials\" mental account, not the \"activewear splurge\" account:\n- \"$100 for your daily uniform\" (like coffee: $5/day x 20 days = $100/month)\n- Comparison anchors: \"Less than a month of daily coffee\" or \"Less than one Lorna Jane legging\"\n- BNPL reinforcement: $25/fortnight via Afterpay = \"the cost of two coffees a week\"\n\n---\n\n## 6. FROTOS — Target Belief Mapping\n\n### Audience 1: The Hybrid Athlete (Female, 22-30, AU Metro)\n\n| FROTOS Dimension | Target |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| **Frequency** | 3-5 brand touches per week (Instagram, TikTok, email) |\n| **Reach** | 150K-200K in first 90 days (Melbourne/Sydney primary, Brisbane secondary) |\n| **Overlap** | Minimum 2 channels per prospect (social + email or social + studio) |\n| **Thinking** | **Before:** \"Activewear is for the gym.\" **After:** \"Intus gets how I actually live — gym, studio, street, all of it.\" |\n| **Overall** | **Before:** \"Never heard of Intus.\" **After:** \"Intus is the Intentional Movement brand — it's different from LSKD/Echt.\" |\n| **Selling** | **Before:** Zero awareness. **After:** Kit trial (first purchase via 60-day guarantee) within 90 days of first touch. |\n\n**Target Belief to Shift:** \"My activewear should work for my whole day, not just my workout.\"\n\n### Audience 2: The Conscious Male (25-35, AU Metro)\n\n| FROTOS Dimension | Target |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| **Frequency** | 2-3 brand touches per week |\n| **Reach** | 50K-75K in first 90 days |\n| **Overlap** | Minimum 2 channels (YouTube + Instagram or social + studio) |\n| **Thinking** | **Before:** \"Men's activewear is either gym-bro (Gymshark) or too expensive (Vuori).\" **After:** \"Intus is the elevated essential that fits my life — clean, no logos, just quality.\" |\n| **Overall** | **Before:** \"Men's activewear options are polarized.\" **After:** \"Intus fills the gap I didn't know existed.\" |\n| **Selling** | **Before:** Zero awareness. **After:** Single piece trial → Kit conversion within 120 days. |\n\n**Target Belief to Shift:** \"There's a brand between gym-bro and premium that's made for how I actually dress.\"\n\n### Audience 3: The AU-Aesthetic Seeker (Female, 20-28, US-Based)\n\n| FROTOS Dimension | Target |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| **Frequency** | 2-3 brand touches per week |\n| **Reach** | 30K-50K in first 90 days (US targeted) |\n| **Overlap** | Minimum 2 channels (TikTok + Instagram) |\n| **Thinking** | **Before:** \"I love Australian activewear but STAX doesn't ship to the US.\" **After:** \"Intus is the AU brand that actually ships to me — and it has a philosophy I connect with.\" |\n| **Overall** | **Before:** \"Australian activewear is inaccessible.\" **After:** \"Intus IS accessible Australian activewear with intention.\" |\n| **Selling** | **Before:** Zero awareness. **After:** Kit purchase (free US shipping >$200 USD) within 90 days. |\n\n**Target Belief to Shift:** \"The Australian aesthetic I want is available and affordable to ship.\"\n\n---\n\n## 7. Lightning Strike Plan\n\n### Strike Architecture: Concentrated 2-Week Launch Window\n\n**Principle:** Intentional Movement is a new category. New categories require Lightning Strikes — concentrated awareness pushes that create the sense of inevitability. Drip marketing cannot build a category.\n\n### Pre-Strike (Weeks -4 to -1): Ground Preparation\n\n| Action | Owner | Timeline |\n|--------|-------|----------|\n| Finalize 3 Kit combinations (Reformer, Street, Recovery) | Product/Creative | Week -4 |\n| Secure 3-5 Melbourne Pilates studio partnerships | Distribution | Week -4 to -2 |\n| Produce \"The Within Story\" founder content (origin of Intus name) | Narrative/Creative | Week -3 |\n| Build \"What's In My Kit\" UGC template for seeding | Creative/Distribution | Week -2 |\n| Seed 10-15 Pilates instructors with Kits (no posting obligation — costly signal) | Distribution | Week -2 |\n| Email list warm-up: \"Something is changing\" teaser sequence | Distribution | Week -1 |\n| 60-day return policy implemented and QA'd on site | Digital | Week -1 |\n\n### Air Wars (Week 1-2): Category Announcement\n\n| Channel | Content | Frequency |\n|---------|---------|-----------|\n| **TikTok** | \"The 23-Hour Question\" — POV content asking what you wear between workouts | 5-7 posts/week |\n| **Instagram** | \"The Kit\" visual reveals — styled as daily uniform, not gym outfit | 4-5 posts/week + Stories daily |\n| **YouTube** | \"The Within Story\" — 3-5 min founder documentary on why movement has meaning | 1 anchor video + 3 shorts |\n| **Email** | \"Introducing Intentional Movement\" — category manifesto + Kit reveal | 3 emails over 2 weeks |\n| **PR** | Pitch to AU fitness/lifestyle media: \"Melbourne brand redefines what activewear is for\" | 5-10 targeted pitches |\n\n### Ground Wars (Week 1-2): Physical Activation\n\n| Activation | Location | Mechanic |\n|------------|----------|----------|\n| \"The Kit Launch\" at partner Pilates studios | 3-5 Melbourne studios | Kit display + QR code for exclusive studio discount. Instructors wear Kits during class. |\n| Melbourne run club activation | 1-2 running groups | \"The Street Kit\" worn by 10 runners. Post-run coffee. Photographer captures the transition (run → cafe). |\n| Pop-up \"Kit Bar\" (if budget allows) | Melbourne athleisure precinct | 48-hour popup where customers build their own Kit from curated options. Not a store — an experience. |\n\n### Post-Strike (Weeks 3-4): Sustain & Convert\n\n- Retarget all Strike engagement with Kit offers (60-day guarantee prominent)\n- Activate UGC: \"What's in your Kit?\" campaign using seeded content from instructors\n- Email nurture: \"The Intentional Movement Guide\" — educational content, not sales\n- Studio partners begin selling Kits as \"recommended member gear\"\n\n### Strike Success Metrics\n\n| Metric | Target | Measurement |\n|--------|--------|-------------|\n| Kit sales (first 30 days) | 200+ Kits | Shopify |\n| Email list growth | +2,000 subscribers | Klaviyo |\n| Social reach (paid + organic) | 500K+ impressions | Platform analytics |\n| Studio partnership conversions | 50+ Kit sales via studio QR | UTM tracking |\n| \"Intentional Movement\" search volume | Baseline → measurable increase | Google Trends |\n| UGC posts (#MyIntusKit) | 50+ within 30 days | Social listening |\n\n---\n\n## 8.
