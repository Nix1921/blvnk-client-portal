  "rawMarkdown": "# Tone of Voice Guide, Word Bank & Copy Deck — Intus\n**Department:** Narrative & Verbal Identity\n**Phase:** 3A | Launch Kit\n**Date:** February 2026\n\n---\n\n## 1. Voice Dimensions\n\n### The Intus Voice: Magician (70%) + Sage (30%)\n\nThe Intus voice sounds like a thoughtful friend who sees things differently — someone who makes you pause and rethink what you thought you knew, without ever lecturing you. Assured but never arrogant. Quiet but never passive. Transformative but always grounded.\n\n| Dimension | Expression | What It Sounds Like | What It NEVER Sounds Like |\n|-----------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Personality** | Intentional, assured, warm, perceptive | A reformer instructor who also reads philosophy | A personal trainer yelling at you / A fashion brand being aloof |\n| **Style** | Short sentences with weight. Statements over exclamations. Questions that reframe. | \"You don't need more clothes. You need the right Kit.\" | \"OMG you NEED this!! Shop now!! Limited time!!\" |\n| **Vocabulary** | Intentional, movement, within, Kit, curated, transition, flow, purpose | Words that suggest awareness and transformation | \"Crush it\", \"beast mode\", \"hustle\", \"slay\", \"buttery soft\" |\n| **Energy** | Calm confidence. 6/10 on the intensity scale. Rises to 7/10 for launches, drops to 5/10 for nurture. | Steady, rhythmic, like a walking pace | Never breathless, never urgent, never aggressive |\n\n### Tone Map (Context-Specific Adjustments)\n\n| Situation | Tone Adjustment | Example |\n|-----------|----------------|---------|\n| **Product launch** | Energy rises to 7/10. More Magician. | \"Something is about to change how you dress. The Reformer Kit is here.\" |\n| **Educational content** | Sage forward (60/40). Reflective, questioning. | \"When was the last time you moved without a destination?\" |\n| **Customer service** | Warm, direct, solution-oriented. No blame. | \"That doesn't sound right. Let's sort this out — reply here or DM us.\" |\n| **Social captions** | Conversational, observation-based. Short. | \"Studio → flat white → everywhere else. One Kit.\" |\n| **Email nurture** | Sage forward. Building understanding. | \"You're about to see your wardrobe differently. Here's why.\" |\n| **Sale/promotion** | DOES NOT EXIST. Intus does not run sales. Price integrity is a core signal. | N/A — see \"Forbidden Contexts\" below |\n| **Error/issue** | Human, accountable, immediate solution. | \"We got that wrong. Here's what we're doing about it.\" |\n\n### Forbidden Contexts\n\nThe Intus voice is NEVER used for:\n- Discount/sale language (The Kit is never discounted)\n- Urgency-based promotion (\"Hurry!\", \"Last chance!\", countdown timers)\n- Competitive comparison (\"Better than Brand X\")\n- Body-focused messaging (\"Get your dream body\", \"Look amazing\")\n- Hustle culture language (\"No excuses\", \"Rise and grind\")\n\n---\n\n## 2. Word Bank\n\n### Power Words (Use Frequently)\n\n| Category | Words |\n|----------|-------|\n| **Movement** | intentional, flow, transition, movement, purpose, rhythm, practice |\n| **Identity** | within, Kit, curated, yours, chosen, daily, ritual |\n| **Transformation** | shift, change, transform, reframe, dissolve, become, emerge |\n| **Quality** | considered, crafted, designed, built, precise, refined |\n| **Feeling** | confident, grounded, right, natural, seamless, effortless |\n| **Community** | circle, together, collective, shared, studio, club |\n\n### Community Words (Brand-Specific Vocabulary)\n\n| Term | Definition | Usage |\n|------|-----------|-------|\n| **The Kit** | A curated top + bottom combination designed as a daily uniform. Always capitalized. | \"Get Your Kit\" / \"What's in your Kit?\" |\n| **Intentional Movement** | The category Intus owns. Movement with awareness and purpose through the full day. | \"Designed for Intentional Movement\" |\n| **Hybrid Athlete** | Intus's target customer. Someone who moves between gym, studio, street, and social life. | \"Built for the Hybrid Athlete\" |\n| **The Within** | The inner space where intention begins. Brand philosophy shorthand. | \"It starts from Within\" |\n| **Transition** | The moments between activities — leaving the studio, arriving at the cafe. Intus's signature moment. | Photography, content, and copy focus |\n\n### Forbidden Words (Never Use)\n\n| Word/Phrase | Why | Replace With |\n|-------------|-----|-------------|\n| \"Buttery soft\" | Generic activewear cliche. Zero differentiation. | Describe the feeling: \"moves with you\" / \"second-skin feel\" |\n| \"Squat-proof\" | Performance jargon. Reduces brand to gym context. | \"Built for your full day\" |\n| \"Sweat-wicking\" | Technical commodity language. | \"Designed to perform from studio to street\" |\n| \"Hustle\" / \"Grind\" / \"Beast mode\" | Hero archetype — belongs to Gymshark/LSKD. | \"Move with intention\" / \"Your practice, your pace\" |\n| \"No excuses\" / \"No days off\" | Toxic fitness culture. Contradicts Sage philosophy. | \"Every movement counts\" |\n| \"Buttery\" / \"Silky\" / \"Luxe\" | Sensory Lover archetype — belongs to STAX. | \"Considered\" / \"Refined\" / \"Precise\" |\n| \"Sale\" / \"Discount\" / \"% off\" | Undermines Magician alchemy. You don't discount magic. | N/A — Intus does not run sales |\n| \"Best\" / \"Leading\" / \"#1\" | Unsubstantiated claims. Breaks Sage authenticity. | Show, don't claim. Let studio partnerships and UGC speak. |\n| \"Eco-friendly\" (as standalone) | Vague sustainability language. | Specific: \"Made with recycled polyester\" or \"Certified by [X]\" |\n| \"Click here\" / \"Submit\" | Dead-end UX language. | \"Get Your Kit\" / \"Start Your Practice\" / \"Join the Circle\" |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Copy Deck\n\n### 3.1 Website Copy\n\n**Homepage Hero Section**\n\n> Your day doesn't happen in segments.\n> Neither should your clothes.\n>\n> Intus creates curated Kits for the Hybrid Athlete — designed for your full day, from studio to street to everywhere in between.\n>\n> [Get Your Kit]\n\n**The Kit Product Page (Template)**\n\n> **The Reformer Kit**\n> [Collection Name] Tank + [Collection Name] Shorts\n>\n> Designed for the day that starts at the studio and doesn't stop. The Reformer Kit moves from reformer class to coffee to your afternoon — one Kit, no compromises.\n>\n> $100 AUD | Afterpay available — $25/fortnight\n>\n> [Get This Kit] [Take the Kit Quiz]\n>\n> **60-day guarantee.** Wear it. Live in it. If it doesn't change how you dress, send it back.\n\n**About Page**\n\n> **Intus means \"within.\"**\n>\n> It's Latin. It's where intention starts. And it's the one place every Hybrid Athlete already has everything they need.\n>\n> We built Intus because we were tired of activewear designed for one hour at the gym. We move through reformer classes, coffee runs, walking meetings, and evening stretches — all in a single day. We needed clothes that moved with us.\n>\n> So we made The Kit. Not a bundle. Not a discount. A curated daily uniform for intentional movement.\n>\n> This isn't about the workout. It's about the full day.\n> It's about what you do between workouts.\n> It's about moving with purpose.\n>\n> The power is within.\n\n*Me/You ratio: 60% you/your, 40% we/our — About page is the one context where \"we\" is higher because it's the brand origin story. Still customer-focused in framing.*\n\n**Collection Page Headers**\n\n| Collection | Header Copy |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| Women's | \"Designed for how you actually move.\" |\n| Men's | \"The space between gym and everything else — filled.\" |\n| Zyra (Leggings) | \"From reformer to restaurant.

Good.\n>\n> Intus isn't about the workout. It's about your full day — the studio, the coffee, the walk, the stretch, the everything in between.\n>\n> We call it Intentional Movement. And The Kit is how you dress for it.\n>\n> Over the next few days, we'll show you what that means.\n>\n> For now — welcome to the circle.\n>\n> [Explore The Kits]\n\n**Email 2: \"The question no one asks\" (Day 3)**\nSubject: What do you do between workouts?\n\n> Most activewear brands obsess over the workout.\n> The fabric. The fit. The performance.\n>\n> But your day is 24 hours. Your workout is one of them.\n>\n> What about the other 23?\n>\n> That's the question we built Intus to answer. The Kit is designed for your whole day — not just the hour you're sweating.\n>\n> [See The Kits]\n\n**Email 3: \"Try it for 60 days\" (Day 7)**\nSubject: Wear it. Live in it. Return it if we're wrong.\n\n> We're confident enough to make this promise:\n>\n> Get your Kit. Wear it for 60 days. To the studio, to work, to the weekend.\n>\n> If it doesn't change how you think about getting dressed, send it back. Full refund. No questions.\n>\n> That's not a sales tactic. It's what happens when a brand actually believes in what it makes.\n>\n> [Get Your Kit — 60-Day Guarantee]\n\n### 3.3 Social Copy Templates\n\n**TikTok/Reels Hooks (First 3 seconds)**\n\n| Hook | Format |\n|------|--------|\n| \"POV: You stop changing clothes 3 times a day\" | Transition video — one Kit, multiple locations |\n| \"The activewear question nobody asks\" | Text on screen → \"What do you wear between workouts?\" |\n| \"One Kit.
