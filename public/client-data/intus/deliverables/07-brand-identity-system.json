  "rawMarkdown": "# Brand Identity System — Intus\n**Department:** Creative & Visual Arts Studio\n**Phase:** 3B | Launch Kit\n**Date:** February 2026\n\n---\n\n## 1. Visual Strategy\n\n### Positioning Tier: Elevated Mid-Range (Between Mass and Luxury)\n\nIntus sits in a specific visual territory — not luxury (that's Vuori, Alo Yoga), not mass (that's Echt, Shein), but **elevated essential**. The visual system must signal quality and intention without signaling inaccessibility.\n\n| Visual Code | Luxury | Intus (Elevated Mid-Range) | Mass |\n|-------------|--------|---------------------------|------|\n| Whitespace | 60%+ | 45-55% | 30-40% |\n| Color palette | 2-3 colors, muted | 3-4 colors, warm neutrals + 1 accent | 5+ colors, saturated |\n| Typography | Serif, custom | Clean sans-serif, geometric | Bold sans-serif, condensed |\n| Photography | Editorial, aspirational | Lifestyle-transitional, natural light | Product-focused, studio lit |\n| Grid | Asymmetric, art-directed | Modular, consistent | Dense, information-heavy |\n\n### Archetype Visual Expression\n\n**Magician (Primary — 70%):**\n- Transformative visual moments (before/after perspective, not body)\n- Warm tonal shifts (light → shadow, indoor → outdoor)\n- Elements that suggest alchemy (two things becoming one — The Kit)\n- Circular/flowing geometry (cycles, transitions, continuity)\n\n**Sage (Secondary — 30%):**\n- Clean, considered composition with intentional negative space\n- Quiet confidence — no visual noise\n- Typography-forward layouts for editorial/educational content\n- Restrained palette (wisdom = restraint)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Color System\n\n### Primary Palette\n\n| Color | Name | Hex | Psychology | Usage |\n|-------|------|-----|-----------|-------|\n| Deep Charcoal | **Within** | #2C2C2C | Depth, grounding, sophistication without pretension | Primary text, logo, headers |\n| Warm White | **Canvas** | #F5F0EB | Openness, warmth, invitation (not clinical white) | Backgrounds, breathing space |\n| Warm Sand | **Ground** | #D4C5B2 | Earth, stability, natural movement | Secondary backgrounds, cards, dividers |\n\n### Accent Palette\n\n| Color | Name | Hex | Psychology | Usage |\n|-------|------|-----|-----------|-------|\n| Burnt Terracotta | **Intention** | #C4704E | Warmth, energy, transformation — Magician's fire | CTAs, highlights, \"Get Your Kit\" buttons |\n| Deep Sage | **Thought** | #7A8B7A | Wisdom, nature, grounded philosophy — Sage's voice | Secondary accents, educational content, tags |\n\n### Extended Palette (Seasonal)\n\n| Color | Name | Hex | Usage |\n|-------|------|-----|-------|\n| Soft Clay | **Dawn** | #E8D5C4 | Seasonal Kit colorways, packaging |\n| Deep Navy | **Depth** | #1E2A3A | Men's collection emphasis, winter seasonal |\n\n### Color Ratios\n\n| Context | 60% (Dominant) | 30% (Secondary) | 10% (Accent) |\n|---------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Website | Canvas (#F5F0EB) | Within (#2C2C2C) + Ground (#D4C5B2) | Intention (#C4704E) |\n| Email | Canvas | Within | Intention (CTA only) |\n| Social | Ground or Canvas | Within | Intention |\n| Packaging | Canvas + Ground | Within | Intention (interior detail) |\n\n### Color Rules\n\n- **Never** use pure white (#FFFFFF) — always Canvas (#F5F0EB) for warmth\n- **Never** use pure black (#000000) — always Within (#2C2C2C) for depth without harshness\n- **Never** use Intention (terracotta) for body text — accent only\n- **Never** use more than 3 colors in a single composition\n- Thought (sage green) is reserved for Sage-expression contexts: educational content, philosophy sections, editorial\n- All color combinations must pass WCAG AA contrast minimum (4.5:1 for text)\n\n### Contrast Verification\n\n| Pair | Ratio | WCAG |\n|------|-------|------|\n| Within on Canvas | 11.2:1 | AAA |\n| Within on Ground | 5.8:1 | AA |\n| Canvas on Within | 11.2:1 | AAA |\n| Intention on Canvas | 4.6:1 | AA |\n| Intention on Within | 3.1:1 | Decorative use only |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Logo System\n\n### Design Direction\n\nThe Intus logo should embody: transformation, interiority, and the dissolving of boundaries (Magician) with considered restraint (Sage).\n\n**Logo Construction Framework:**\n\n| Element | Direction | Rationale |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| Wordmark | Clean geometric sans-serif. Custom letterforms for \"I\" and \"S\". | Sage clarity + Magician subtlety. The custom letters carry hidden meaning. |\n| Logomark (optional) | Abstract circle with interior movement — suggesting \"within\" | Magician (internal transformation). Circle = wholeness, continuity, the full day. |\n| Construction grid | Golden Ratio (phi) proportions for letter spacing and mark | Mathematical precision = Sage credibility |\n\n**Logo Variations Required:**\n\n| Variant | Use Case |\n|---------|----------|\n| Primary (wordmark + mark) | Website header, packaging, hero placements |\n| Wordmark only | Social profiles, email headers, small applications |\n| Mark only | Favicon, app icon, embroidery, repeat patterns |\n| Reversed (Canvas on Within) | Dark backgrounds, photography overlays |\n| Monochrome (Within only) | Print, embossing, single-color applications |\n\n**Logo Clear Space:** Minimum clear space = height of the \"I\" in \"INTUS\" on all sides.\n\n**Logo Minimum Size:** 24px height (digital), 10mm height (print).\n\n**Logo Don'ts:**\n- Never stretch, rotate, or distort\n- Never place on busy/patterned backgrounds without sufficient contrast\n- Never add effects (shadows, gradients, outlines)\n- Never change the color palette\n- Never recreate in a non-approved typeface\n\n---\n\n## 4. Typography System\n\n### Type Scale (Modular Scale: 1.25 ratio — Major Third)\n\n| Level | Size (px) | Weight | Use |\n|-------|-----------|--------|-----|\n| Display | 48 / 3rem | Light (300) | Hero headlines, manifesto text |\n| H1 | 38 / 2.375rem | Regular (400) | Page titles |\n| H2 | 30 / 1.875rem | Regular (400) | Section headers |\n| H3 | 24 / 1.5rem | Medium (500) | Subsection headers |\n| Body | 16 / 1rem | Regular (400) | Paragraph text, descriptions |\n| Body Small | 14 / 0.875rem | Regular (400) | Captions, metadata |\n| Micro | 12 / 0.75rem | Medium (500) | Labels, tags, legal |\n\n### Font Selection Direction\n\n| Role | Direction | Rationale |\n|------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Primary (Headlines)** | Geometric sans-serif with humanist warmth (e.g., Neue Montreal, General Sans, or Satoshi) | Magician: geometric precision suggests transformation through design. Sage: clean legibility signals thoughtfulness. Humanist warmth prevents clinical coldness. |\n| **Secondary (Body)** | Inter or system sans-serif | Maximum readability. Sage: clarity over decoration. |\n\n**Typography Rules:**\n- Line height: 1.5 for body, 1.2 for headlines\n- Letter spacing: +0.02em for all-caps micro text, 0 for body, -0.01em for display\n- Maximum line width: 65-75 characters for body text\n- Never use italic for emphasis — use Medium weight instead\n- Never use ALL CAPS for more than 3 words consecutively (except micro labels)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Photography Direction\n\n### The Signature Moment: Transition\n\nThe Intus visual language captures **the space between** — the moment of leaving, arriving, transitioning. This is the Magician's territory: dissolving the boundary between \"workout\" and \"life.\"\n\n### Shot Types\n\n| Shot Type | Description | Archetype | Example |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------|\n| **The Transition** | Subject moving between environments — leaving the studio door, sitting at a cafe, walking down a street | Magician | Walking out of a Pilates studio into morning light, Kit visible, bag over shoulder |\n| **The Full Day** | Time-lapse or sequence showing the same Kit across multiple activities | Magician | 4-panel: reformer → coffee → walking → evening stretch |\n| **The Detail** | Close-up of fabric, stitching, or design detail with natural light | Sage | Fabric texture caught in afternoon light, fingers touching seam |\n| **The Collective** | Two or more Hybrid Athletes together in a non-gym setting | Sage/Magician | Friends in Kits at a cafe table, post-studio, natural and candid |\n\n### Photography Rules\n\n| Rule | Rationale |\n|------|-----------|\n| **Natural light only.** No studio flash, no ring lights. | Magician: natural light creates transformation (golden hour, morning light). Sage: honesty — no artificial enhancement. |\n| **Location: always in transition.** Doorways, streets, cafes, parks — never inside a gym. | The Kit is for the full day. Gym photography contradicts the POV. |\n| **Subjects: mid-movement or just-arrived.** Never static poses, never \"looking at camera and smiling.\" | Magician: movement = transformation. Sage: candid = authentic. |\n| **Wardrobe: always The Kit.** Never styled with non-Intus pieces in hero shots. | The Kit is the identity. Mixing dilutes the alchemy. |\n| **Diversity: reflect the Hybrid Athlete.** Multiple body types, ethnicities, genders. No fitness-model casting. | Sage: wisdom doesn't discriminate. Magician: transformation is for everyone. |\n| **Color grading: warm, slightly desaturated.** Match the Canvas/Ground palette. | Consistent visual temperature. Never cold/blue-toned (clinical). Never oversaturated (mass-market). |\n| **Never show price or promotional text on photography.** | Magician: you don't put a price tag on magic. Sage: photography is for meaning, not selling. |\n\n### Mood References\n\n| Mood | Visual Language |\n|------|----------------|\n| Melbourne morning | Cool light warming to gold. Empty streets. A figure walking with purpose. |\n| Post-studio calm | Slight perspiration. Hair up. Coffee in hand. Sitting outside. Natural. |\n| Evening transition | Golden hour. A stretch on the balcony. Movement slowing down. |\n| The collective | Friends together, not performing. Laughter. Walking. Real moments. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Packaging Specifications\n\n### Packaging Philosophy: Unboxing as Ritual\n\nThe Kit arrives as a unified identity, not separate items in a bag. The packaging IS the Magician's reveal — two items become one Kit through the unboxing experience.\n\n| Element | Specification | Rationale |\n|---------|---------------|-----------|\n| **Outer mailer** | Matte finish, Ground (#D4C5B2) base, Within (#2C2C2C) wordmark | Matte = naturalness, trust (not glossy mass-market). Ground color = warmth. |\n| **Interior** | Canvas (#F5F0EB) tissue paper, single printed line: \"The power is within.\" | Magician reveal. The message is discovered, not displayed. |\n| **Kit wrap** | Both Kit pieces wrapped together (not separately) in a single band | Alchemy: two items presented as one identity. The Kit is ONE product. |\n| **Kit band** | Terracotta (#C4704E) paper band with Kit name printed | Accent color at the moment of reveal. \"The Reformer Kit\" — identity, not SKU. |\n| **Insert** | Card stock, 100x150mm: \"Your Kit. Your day. Move with intention.\" + care instructions on reverse | Sage: considered, useful. Not a promotional flyer. |\n| **Material** | Recycled cardstock, soy-based inks, no plastic | Sustainability as baseline (per Phase 1A intelligence), not selling point. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Integration Outputs to Downstream Departments\n\n| To | Output |\n|----|--------|\n| **Digital & Systems** | Color tokens (hex values), typography scale, 8pt grid specs, button styles (Intention terracotta), photography specs for web implementation. |\n| **Distribution & Growth** | Social media visual templates, photography direction for content shoots, packaging unboxing sequence for UGC potential. |\n| **Narrative & Verbal** | Visual-verbal alignment confirmed: warm neutral palette matches assured/warm voice. Terracotta accent matches Magician transformation energy. |\n\n---\n\n*Deliverable 7 of 16 — Intus Launch Kit*\n*Next: Design System (Deliverable 8)*\n"
