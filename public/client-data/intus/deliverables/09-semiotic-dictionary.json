  "rawMarkdown": "# Semiotic Dictionary — Intus\n**Department:** Creative & Visual Arts Studio\n**Phase:** 3B | Launch Kit\n**Date:** February 2026\n\n---\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis dictionary maps every visual and verbal sign in the Intus brand system to its intended meaning. It ensures semiotic consistency — that every signifier (what customers see/hear) triggers the correct signified (what they understand/feel). If a sign points to the wrong meaning, the brand fractures.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Signs\n\n### The Brand Name\n\n| Sign | Signifier | Signified | Type |\n|------|-----------|-----------|------|\n| **\"Intus\"** | Latin word, unfamiliar but pronounceable | Inner power, hidden depth, something beneath the surface. Not foreign — foundational. | Symbol (arbitrary convention, requires learning) |\n| **\"Within\"** | Preposition of interiority | The source is inside you, not external. Self-reliance without isolation. | Index (causal: \"within\" → internal origin) |\n\n**Semiotic Risk:** If \"Intus\" is never explained, it reads as generic brand gibberish. The Latin origin MUST be communicated early (About page, welcome email, packaging insert) to activate the Magician signified.\n\n### The Kit\n\n| Sign | Signifier | Signified | Type |\n|------|-----------|-----------|------|\n| **\"The Kit\"** (capitalized) | A curated set, unified by name | Identity product, not a bundle discount. You don't \"buy two items\" — you \"get your Kit.\" | Symbol |\n| **Kit wrap band** (terracotta) | Two pieces bound together by a single band | Alchemy — two things becoming one. The transformation happens at the moment of unboxing. | Icon (visually represents unity) |\n| **Kit naming** (The Reformer Kit, The Street Kit) | Activity-based names | Each Kit has a purpose. Your Kit choice signals your practice, not your size or budget. | Index (name → lifestyle) |\n\n### The Category\n\n| Sign | Signifier | Signified | Type |\n|------|-----------|-----------|------|\n| **\"Intentional Movement\"** | Two-word phrase combining awareness + action | A new way to think about exercise — not performance, not punishment, but purposeful daily motion. | Symbol (category name — requires education) |\n| **\"The other 23 hours\"** | Numerical contrast (1 hour gym vs. 23 hours everything else) | The industry has it backwards. The majority of your day matters more than the workout. | Index (number → reframing) |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Color Signs\n\n| Color | Signifier | Signified | Cultural Code |\n|-------|-----------|-----------|---------------|\n| **Within (#2C2C2C)** | Deep charcoal, almost-black | Depth, grounding, sophistication. Not cold (it's warm charcoal, not cool gray). Not aggressive (it's not pure black). | Premium-accessible. Serious without being intimidating. |\n| **Canvas (#F5F0EB)** | Warm off-white | Openness, invitation, natural warmth. Not clinical (that's #FFFFFF). Not blank — warm, like a canvas waiting for intention. | Wellness/natural — aligns with Pilates studio aesthetics, not hospital or tech-sterile. |\n| **Ground (#D4C5B2)** | Warm sand/clay | Earth, stability, foundation. The physical ground beneath movement. | Melbourne aesthetic — urban neutral, not beach/coastal (that's Vuori). |\n| **Intention (#C4704E)** | Burnt terracotta | Transformation energy, warmth, the spark that initiates change. Magician's fire. | Action without aggression. Warmth without excess. Not red (urgency/danger) — terracotta is red that's been tempered by earth. |\n| **Thought (#7A8B7A)** | Deep sage green | Wisdom, nature, philosophy. The Sage's color. | Natural intelligence. Not neon/fresh green (health food) — deep and considered. |\n\n### Color Pairing Semiotics\n\n| Pairing | Reads As | Use |\n|---------|----------|-----|\n| Within + Canvas | Authority with warmth (Sage-forward) | Body text, editorial, educational content |\n| Canvas + Intention | Invitation to transform (Magician-forward) | CTAs, hero sections, product highlights |\n| Ground + Within | Grounded stability (foundation) | Secondary sections, card backgrounds |\n| Canvas + Thought | Quiet wisdom | Philosophy content, \"Movement Guide\" |\n| Within + Intention | Energized depth | Accent moments, Kit reveals, packaging details |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Typography Signs\n\n| Element | Signifier | Signified |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Geometric sans-serif (headlines)** | Clean, mathematical letterforms | Precision with warmth. Designed, not decorated. Magician: intentional construction. |\n| **Light weight (display)** | Thin strokes, breathing space | Confidence through restraint. You don't need to shout. Sage: quiet authority. |\n| **Medium weight (emphasis)** | Slightly heavier than body, not bold | Considered emphasis. Not aggressive (bold) — intentional. |\n| **ALL CAPS (micro labels)** | Small text in uppercase | Functional, structured. Used sparingly = signals importance. Overused = loses meaning. |\n| **Generous line height (1.5)** | Text breathes, doesn't crowd | Intentionality extends to reading experience. Nothing is rushed. |\n\n### What Typography NEVER Signals\n\n| Never | Because |\n|-------|---------|\n| Italic | Suggests uncertainty or aside — breaks Magician assurance |\n| Bold (heavy weights) | Suggests aggression — Hero archetype territory |\n| Script/handwritten | Suggests casualness or femininity — too narrow, breaks dual-gender positioning |\n| Condensed type | Suggests urgency or information density — mass-market code |\n| Decorative type | Suggests playfulness — Jester territory |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Photography Signs\n\n| Visual Element | Signifier | Signified |\n|----------------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Natural light** | Sun, window light, golden hour | Authenticity. Nothing hidden, nothing manufactured. Sage: truth needs no studio lighting. |\n| **Transition moments** | Doorways, streets between locations, arriving/leaving | The in-between IS the point. Magician: boundaries dissolve. This is where Intus lives. |\n| **Warm color grade** | Slightly desaturated, warm tones | Comfort without artifice. Not cold/editorial (luxury) or oversaturated (mass). |\n| **Candid subjects** | Not posing, not performing, mid-movement | Real life, not a photoshoot. Sage: authenticity. The subject doesn't know they're being watched — or doesn't care. |\n| **Empty space around subject** | Person occupies 40-60% of frame | Room to breathe. Intentional composition. The space IS part of the message. |\n| **Two contexts in one frame** | Gym bag + coffee cup. Studio door + street. | The Hybrid Athlete doesn't choose between worlds. The Kit bridges them. |\n\n### What Photography NEVER Shows\n\n| Never | Because |\n|-------|---------|\n| Gym interiors | Contradicts \"the other 23 hours\" POV. Intus is not gym-wear. |\n| Mirror selfies | Social media cliche. Breaks Sage authenticity. |\n| Posed fitness shots | Hero archetype territory (Gymshark, LSKD). |\n| Body close-ups | Lover archetype territory (STAX). Intus is about movement, not body. |\n| Pure white backgrounds | Clinical, e-commerce generic. Use Canvas or natural settings. |\n| Price overlays on images | You don't put a price tag on magic. Keep commerce and photography separate. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Material Signs\n\n| Material | Signifier | Signified | Use |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|-----|\n| **Matte cardstock (packaging)** | Smooth, non-reflective surface | Naturalness, trust, considered quality. Not glossy (mass-market). | Mailer, inserts, Kit band |\n| **Recycled stock** | Visible fiber texture, slightly imperfect | Intentional sustainability — not performed, embodied. | All paper/card materials |\n| **Terracotta accent (Kit band)** | A warm color reveal inside neutral packaging | The Magician's moment — the transformation is discovered inside, not displayed outside. | Kit band around paired items |\n| **Fabric (product)** | Mid-weight, structured-but-soft hand feel | \"Designed for a full day\" — not too technical (gym), not too loose (loungewear). The feel confirms the positioning. | The Kit itself |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Verbal Signs\n\n| Word/Phrase | Signifier | Signified |\n|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| **\"Get Your Kit\"** | Imperative + possessive | This is already yours — you're claiming it, not buying it. Magician: the Kit was always meant for you. |\n| **\"Move with intention\"** | Verb + preposition + noun | Movement is a practice with purpose, not a chore or performance. Sage: awareness transforms action. |\n| **\"The power is within\"** | Declarative, present tense | Transformation doesn't require external products — it starts inside. The brand gives you permission, not power. |\n| **\"Join the Circle\"** | Community metaphor | Equality (circle = no hierarchy). Belonging without exclusion. Not a \"team\" (hierarchical) or \"squad\" (casual). |\n| **\"From studio to street\"** | Spatial transition | The Kit bridges environments. Your life is one continuous flow. Magician: boundaries dissolve. |\n| **\"The other 23\"** | Numerical contrast | Reframes the industry's obsession with the workout hour. 23 > 1. The majority wins. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Anti-Semiotic Audit — Signs That Contradict the Brand\n\n| Sign | What It Signals | Why It Contradicts Intus |\n|------|----------------|-------------------------|\n| \"SALE\" or \"% OFF\" | Desperation, overstock, low confidence | Magician's alchemy is devalued. You don't discount transformation. |\n| Pure black (#000000) | Harshness, absolutism | Intus is warm depth (Within #2C2C2C), not cold authority. |\n| Pure white (#FFFFFF) | Clinical, sterile | Intus is warm invitation (Canvas #F5F0EB), not hospital. |\n| Glossy packaging | Mass-market, artificial, disposable | Contradicts Sage naturalness and sustainability. |\n| Gym photography | Performance culture, body obsession | Contradicts \"the other 23 hours\" and Sage anti-hustle positioning. |\n| Bold/heavy type | Aggression, shouting, urgency | Hero archetype. Intus speaks with Sage assurance, not Hero volume. |\n| Countdown timers | Manufactured urgency, scarcity manipulation | Fake scarcity breaks Sage trust permanently. |\n| \"Best seller\" badge | Conformity pressure, generic retail | Intus curates, not ranks. Every Kit is intentional, not popular. |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Semiotic Consistency Checklist\n\nBefore any new asset goes live, verify:\n\n- [ ] Every color used maps to the defined palette and its intended signified\n- [ ] Photography shows transition moments, not gym/static/posed\n- [ ] Typography weights stay within Light-Medium range (no Bold)\n- [ ] All copy uses approved vocabulary (check Word Bank in Deliverable 6)\n- [ ] No forbidden words appear anywhere in the asset\n- [ ] Material choices match the signified (matte not gloss, recycled not virgin)\n- [ ] The Kit is presented as one identity, never as \"two items for $X\"\n- [ ] No price appears on or overlaid on photography\n- [ ] Warm tone maintained (no cool/blue color grading)\n- [ ] Customer is Hero, brand is Guide (check Me/You ratio if copy-heavy)\n\n---\n\n*Deliverable 9 of 16 — Intus Launch Kit*\n*Next: Gate 3 — Identity Review*\n"
