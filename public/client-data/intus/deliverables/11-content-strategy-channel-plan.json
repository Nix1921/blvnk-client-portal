  "rawMarkdown": "# Content Strategy & Channel Plan — Intus\n**Department:** Distribution & Growth Engine\n**Phase:** 5A | Launch Kit\n**Date:** February 2026\n\n---\n\n## 1. Channel Strategy\n\n### Channel Selection (Based on Audience + Goal)\n\n| Channel | Role | Priority | Rationale |\n|---------|------|----------|-----------|\n| **TikTok** | Discovery + Virality | PRIMARY | Gen Z/Millennial Hybrid Athlete lives here. Completion rate > follower count. \"POV\" format is native. Interest-based algo means zero followers can still reach millions. |\n| **Instagram** | Lifestyle Affinity + Social Proof | PRIMARY | Aesthetic branding home. Saves & Sends = 5x more valuable than likes. UGC (#MyIntusKit) gallery. Studio partnership co-content. |\n| **YouTube** | Trust + Search + Long-form | SECONDARY | \"The Within Story\" documentary anchor. Movement Philosophy content for Sage expression. SEO value compounds. Shorts as bridge to long-form. |\n| **Email/SMS (Klaviyo)** | Lifecycle + Retention | PRIMARY | Owned channel — not algorithmic. Welcome sequence, Kit Quiz follow-up, post-purchase nurture. Most Sage-forward channel (60/40 Magician/Sage). |\n| **Pinterest** | Visual Discovery + Intent | TERTIARY | \"Activewear outfit\" search intent. Kit styling boards. Long content lifespan. Low priority at launch, grow post-month-3. |\n\n### Channels NOT Used at Launch\n\n| Channel | Why Not |\n|---------|---------|\n| Facebook | Declining Gen Z presence. Budget better spent on TikTok/Instagram. Reassess month 6. |\n| LinkedIn | Not a lifestyle/consumer channel. Only for B2B partnerships (studios, wholesale). |\n| X/Twitter | Not aligned with brand energy. External links penalized 50-90%. Reassess if cultural conversation shifts. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Content Architecture: Hub-and-Spoke Flywheel\n\n### The Hub: Weekly Anchor Content\n\nOne major content piece per week drives the flywheel. All spoke content derives from it.\n\n| Week Type | Hub Content | Channel | Spoke Outputs |\n|-----------|-------------|---------|---------------|\n| **Philosophy Week** | Movement Philosophy article/video (\"Why every movement counts\") | YouTube long-form + Blog | 5 TikToks, 3 Reels, 2 carousel posts, 1 email |\n| **Kit Week** | Kit spotlight + styling guide (\"3 Ways to Wear The Reformer Kit\") | Instagram Reels + Blog | 5 TikToks, 3 IG posts, 1 YouTube Short, 1 email |\n| **Community Week** | UGC compilation + studio partner feature | Instagram + TikTok | 3 IG posts, 3 TikToks, 1 YouTube Short, 1 email |\n| **Founder Week** | \"The Within Story\" chapter / behind-the-scenes | YouTube + Instagram | 5 TikToks, 3 Reels, 2 IG Stories, 1 email |\n\n**Target: 1 hub → 15-20 spokes per week = 60-80 pieces of content per month from 4 hubs.**\n\n### Content Pillars (Mapped to Archetype)\n\n| Pillar | Archetype | Content Examples | Ratio |\n|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------|\n| **The Transformation** | Magician (primary) | POV transitions, Kit reveals, before/after perspective shifts | 40% |\n| **The Philosophy** | Sage (secondary) | Movement philosophy, \"the other 23 hours\" essays, mindful movement guides | 25% |\n| **The Community** | Both | UGC, studio features, \"What's In My Kit\", customer stories | 25% |\n| **The Product** | Magician | Kit spotlights, fabric stories, new colorway drops | 10% |\n\n**Note: Product content is only 10%. Intus sells meaning, not merch. The Kit sells itself when the philosophy lands.**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Platform-Specific Content Formats\n\n### TikTok (5-7 posts/week)\n\n| Format | Hook (First 1.5s) | Structure | Length |\n|--------|-------------------|-----------|--------|\n| **POV: Transition** | \"POV: You stop changing clothes 3 times a day\" | Day-in-the-life: studio → coffee → street in one Kit | 15-30s |\n| **The Question** | \"The activewear question nobody asks\" | Text reveal → \"What do you wear between workouts?\" → Kit reveal | 10-15s |\n| **What's In My Kit** | Person holds up Kit pieces | Quick styling + \"This is my [Reformer/Street/Recovery] Kit\" | 15-20s |\n| **Philosophy Drop** | Provocative statement on screen | \"Your gym clothes weren't designed for your day\" → short essay | 30-60s |\n| **Sound trend remix** | Trending audio + Intus-relevant visual | Adapt trending format to transition/Kit narrative | 10-30s |\n\n**TikTok Rules:**\n- Hook in first 1.5s (visual change or text)\n- Visual change every 3 seconds (3-Second Rule)\n- End on payoff, cut immediately (Quit While Ahead)\n- No watermarks when reposting to Instagram\n- Completion rate > everything else\n\n### Instagram (4-5 posts/week + daily Stories)\n\n| Format | Type | Content |\n|--------|------|---------|\n| **Reels** | Video (15-60s) | Same as TikTok but re-edited (no TikTok watermark). Transition POVs, Kit styling. |\n| **Carousel** | 5-7 slides | \"The Philosophy of Intentional Movement\" / \"5 Signs You're a Hybrid Athlete\" / Kit lookbook |\n| **Single image** | Lifestyle photo | Transition moment photography (per Deliverable 7 photography direction) |\n| **Stories** | Daily | Behind-the-scenes, polls (\"Reformer or Street Kit?\"), studio partner features, repost UGC |\n\n**Instagram Rules:**\n- Saves & Sends are the primary metric (5x more valuable than likes)\n- Carousel posts get highest reach for educational content\n- Never post a TikTok with watermark\n- Stories: use polls/questions for engagement (algorithm signal)\n\n### YouTube (1-2 videos/week)\n\n| Format | Type | Content |\n|--------|------|---------|\n| **Long-form** (1/month) | 5-10 min | \"The Within Story\" chapters, Movement Philosophy deep dives |\n| **Shorts** (1-2/week) | <60s | Bridge content from TikTok — re-edited, vertical, with end card linking to long-form |\n\n**YouTube Rules:**\n- Long-form = trust + search SEO (compounds over time)\n- Shorts = discovery (Explore/Exploit algorithm)\n- Thumbnail: high contrast, <4 words, mobile-legible, face + emotion\n- Title: front-load keyword, <60 characters\n- Upload 1-2 hours before peak audience activity\n\n### Email (Klaviyo — 2-3 emails/week)\n\nSee Deliverable 12 for full lifecycle system.\n\n---\n\n## 4.
