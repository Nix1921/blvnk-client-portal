  "rawMarkdown": "# Ad Creative Testing Framework — Intus\n**Department:** Distribution & Growth Engine\n**Phase:** 5A | Launch Kit\n**Date:** February 2026\n\n---\n\n## 1. Testing Architecture: 3-Phase System\n\n### Phase 1: Pre-Flight (New vs. New)\n\n**Purpose:** Find winning concepts from a pool of untested creatives.\n\n| Parameter | Setting |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Campaign type | ABO (Ad Set Budget Optimization) or ASC+ |\n| Budget | $20-30/day per ad set |\n| Duration | 3-5 days |\n| Ad sets | 3-5 ad sets, each with 1-2 creatives |\n| Audience | Broad targeting (let algorithm find the Hybrid Athlete) |\n| Optimization | Purchase or Add to Cart (not link clicks — vanity metric) |\n\n**Creative concepts to test at launch:**\n\n| Concept | Hook | Format | Archetype |\n|---------|------|--------|-----------|\n| A: \"The Question\" | \"What do you wear between workouts?\" | Text overlay → Kit reveal | Sage |\n| B: \"POV Transition\" | \"POV: One outfit, your whole day\" | Day-in-the-life video | Magician |\n| C: \"The Kit\" | \"This is The Reformer Kit. $100.\" | Product showcase, lifestyle context | Magician |\n| D: \"Guarantee\" | \"Wear it for 60 days. Return if we're wrong.\" | UGC-style, direct-to-camera | Sage |\n| E: \"The Math\" | \"Your day is 24 hours. Your workout is 1.\" | Text-heavy, typography-forward | Sage |\n\n**Decision rule after 3-5 days:**\n- CPA < target → Winner (advance to Phase 2)\n- CPA = target → Neutral (backup pool)\n- CPA > 2x target → Kill\n\n### Phase 2: New vs. BAU (Winners vs. Evergreen)\n\n**Purpose:** Validate that new winners outperform current best performers.\n\n| Parameter | Setting |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Campaign type | ABO or CBO |\n| Budget | $30-50/day per ad set |\n| Duration | 5-7 days |\n| Structure | 2 ad sets: Phase 1 winners vs. current best performers |\n\n**Decision rule:**\n- New ad CPA < BAU CPA → New winner confirmed → advance to Phase 3\n- New ad CPA ≈ BAU CPA → Add to rotation (creative diversity)\n- New ad CPA > BAU CPA → Return to backup pool, don't scale\n\n### Phase 3: Scaling\n\n**Purpose:** Put validated winners into high-budget campaigns for acquisition.\n\n| Parameter | Setting |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Campaign type | CBO or ASC+ |\n| Budget | Scale gradually (increase 20-30% every 3-4 days) |\n| Monitoring | Daily CPA check. If CPA rises >30% for 3 consecutive days → reduce budget or rotate creative. |\n| Creative refresh | Every 3-4 weeks (or when frequency > 3-4 per user per week) |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Runoff Testing (Hidden Unicorn Discovery)\n\n**Problem:** Meta's algorithm sometimes gives zero spend to ads that could be winners — it just never tested them.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. After Phase 1, identify any ads with $0 or <$5 spend\n2. Move them to a dedicated \"Runoff\" ad set with forced equal budget distribution\n3. Run for 3 days at $20/day\n4. Check for hidden winners that the algorithm overlooked\n\n**This has historically surfaced 15-20% of eventual top performers that would have been killed as \"losers.\"**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Ad Fatigue Detection & Response\n\n### Fatigue Signals\n\n| Signal | Threshold | Action |\n|--------|-----------|--------|\n| CTR declining consistently | 3+ days of decline | Rotate creative |\n| CPM/CPC rising | >20% increase over baseline | Expand audience or rotate |\n| Frequency | >3-4 per user per week | Rotate creative, implement frequency caps |\n| CPA rising | >30% above target for 3+ days | Reduce budget, test new creative |\n\n### Creative Refresh Protocol\n\n**Monthly cycle:**\n- Week 1: Launch 3-5 new concepts (Phase 1 Pre-Flight)\n- Week 2: Test winners vs. BAU (Phase 2)\n- Week 3-4: Scale winners, monitor fatigue\n- End of month: Kill fatigued creative, prepare next batch\n\n**Creative diversity rule:** Always have 3+ active creatives in scaling campaigns. Never rely on a single ad.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Platform-Specific Ad Specs\n\n### Meta (Instagram + Facebook)\n\n| Placement | Format | Dimensions | Duration |\n|-----------|--------|------------|----------|\n| Feed | Video | 1:1 (1080x1080) or 4:5 (1080x1350) | 15-30s |\n| Stories/Reels | Video | 9:16 (1080x1920) | 15-30s |\n| Feed | Image | 1:1 (1080x1080) | Static |\n\n### TikTok\n\n| Placement | Format | Dimensions | Duration |\n|-----------|--------|------------|----------|\n| In-Feed | Video | 9:16 (1080x1920) | 15-60s |\n| TopView | Video | 9:16 | 5-60s |\n\n### YouTube\n\n| Placement | Format | Dimensions | Duration |\n|-----------|--------|------------|----------|\n| Shorts ads | Video | 9:16 | 15-60s |\n| In-stream (skippable) | Video | 16:9 | 15-30s (hook in first 5s before skip) |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Budget Allocation (Launch Month)\n\n### Recommended Monthly Budget: $2,000-$3,000 AUD\n\n| Channel | Allocation | Purpose |\n|---------|-----------|---------|\n| Meta (IG + FB) | 50% ($1,000-1,500) | Primary acquisition. Kit Quiz traffic + retargeting. |\n| TikTok | 30% ($600-900) | Discovery. Broad awareness. POV content amplification. |\n| YouTube | 10% ($200-300) | Retargeting only at launch. Scale post-month-3 with long-form. |\n| Testing reserve | 10% ($200-300) | Phase 1 Pre-Flight and Runoff testing. |\n\n### CAC Targets\n\n| Metric | Target | Rationale |\n|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Prospecting CAC (new customer) | < $30 AUD | Kit AOV = $100. 30% margin = $30 contribution. CAC must be below this. |\n| Retargeting CAC | < $15 AUD | Warm audience should convert at ~2x efficiency. |\n| Blended CAC | Track but don't optimize on | Blended hides true channel performance. Always layer. |\n| nROAS (new customer) | > 3x | New customer revenue / ad spend. The metric that matters. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Creative Rules (Brand Compliance)\n\n| Rule | Rationale |\n|------|-----------|\n| No discount language in ads | Magician rule: you don't discount magic. |\n| 60-day guarantee is the hook, not a coupon | The guarantee IS the conversion tool. |\n| Always show Kit as one product, not \"2 items for $100\" | Bundle-as-identity, not bundle-as-discount. |\n| UGC-style > polished studio | Gen Z trusts authenticity over production value. |\n| Transition moments in video, not gym footage | Brand photography direction (Deliverable 7). |\n| \"Get Your Kit\" CTA, not \"Shop Now\" | Consistent across all touchpoints (Deliverable 6). |\n\n---\n\n*Deliverable 13 of 16 — Intus Launch Kit*\n"
