  "rawMarkdown": "# CRO Playbook — Intus Ecommerce Supplement\n**Supplements:** Deliverable 10 (Website UX Wireframes & Digital Architecture)\n**Department:** Digital & Systems Architecture\n**Intelligence Source:** Ecommerce CRO Notebook (280+ sources, 2025 benchmarks)\n**Date:** February 2026\n\n---\n\n## Why This Supplement Exists\n\nDeliverable 10 established the UX wireframes, information architecture, and conversion funnel for intus.com.au. It correctly identified the trust gap, guest checkout priority, and Kit-first navigation. However, it was built before Intus had access to 2025 ecommerce CRO benchmarks. This supplement adds the specific conversion optimization playbook — benchmarks, tactics, and implementation priorities — that will move Intus from the Shopify average (1.4% conversion) toward the top 20% (3.2%+).\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Revenue Math: Why CRO Is Your Highest-ROI Investment\n\nBefore spending more on ads, optimize what you already have.\n\n| Scenario | Monthly Traffic | Conv. Rate | Orders | AOV | Monthly Revenue |\n|----------|----------------|-----------|--------|-----|-----------------|\n| **Current (Shopify avg)** | 10,000 | 1.4% | 140 | $100 | $14,000 |\n| **Target (top 20%)** | 10,000 | 3.2% | 320 | $100 | $32,000 |\n| **Delta** | Same traffic | +1.8% | +180 | — | **+$18,000/mo** |\n\nA 1.8% absolute lift = **128% more revenue from the same traffic**. Every CRO improvement compounds with every dollar spent on acquisition.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Product Detail Page (PDP) Optimization\n\nThe Kit PDP in Deliverable 10 uses an asymmetric split (60% visual / 40% content) with accordion details — a solid foundation. These additions target the specific conversion gaps for a DTC Intentional Movement brand.\n\n### 2.1 Visual Gallery Upgrade\n\n**Current (Deliverable 10):** Kit image with thumbnail angle views.\n\n**Enhanced:**\n\n| Element | Specification | Why |\n|---------|--------------|-----|\n| **Image count** | 6-8 images per Kit (currently underspecified) | Apparel requires: front, back, side, detail/fabric, lifestyle x2, size comparison, flat lay |\n| **Mixed media gallery** | Static images + 15-second video clip per Kit | Mobile gallery optimization with mixed media improves engagement by 19% |\n| **Video content** | Show the Kit in motion — reformer transition to coffee run (outdoor/lifestyle setting, never gym interiors) | Proves the \"full day\" POV. Video on PDP increases time-on-page and reduces bounce. |\n| **UGC integration** | Customer photos from #MyIntusKit displayed in gallery (not just below fold) | UGC on PDP converts 74% higher than brand-only imagery. Place above the fold or within the first scroll. |\n| **Zoom functionality** | Pinch-to-zoom on mobile, hover-zoom on desktop | Bridges the \"sensory gap\" — customers need to see fabric texture and stitch quality |\n\n### 2.2 Size & Fit Intelligence\n\n**Current (Deliverable 10):** Interactive size guide mentioned in Trust Gap Remediation table.\n\n**Enhanced:**\n\n| Feature | Implementation | Impact |\n|---------|---------------|--------|\n| **Fit predictor tool** | Integrate Kiwi Sizing, True Fit, or Shopify-native size quiz. Customer inputs height + weight + usual brand size → gets recommendation | Reduces returns by 12-18%. For performance apparel (where fit is critical), this is non-negotiable. |\n| **\"How does it fit?\" UGC** | Customer review photos tagged with their size, height, weight | More credible than brand size charts. Enables \"Find someone like me\" browsing. |\n| **Fit language** | \"True to size — designed for movement, not compression\" with body measurement reference points | Positions fit in Intus's own terms. Avoids anchoring to competitors, which undermines category-creator positioning. |\n| **Body-inclusive imagery** | Size models across range (XS-XL minimum) in product photos | Reduces fit anxiety. Inclusive brands see 15-20% lower return rates on size-related returns. |\n\n### 2.3 Social Proof Placement\n\n**Current (Deliverable 10):** Reviews/UGC section below the lifestyle strip on Kit PDP.\n\n**Enhanced placement strategy:**\n\n```\nKit PDP — Optimized Order:\n1. Hero gallery (6-8 images + video + UGC)\n2. Price + BNPL breakdown + Size selector\n3. ★★★★★ review count + \"Trusted by X intentional movers\" ← MOVE UP\n4. [Get This Kit] — sticky on mobile\n5. 60-day guarantee badge\n6. Accordion details\n7. Lifestyle strip\n8. Full review section with photos\n9. \"Complete Your Kit\" cross-sell\n```\n\n**Key change:** Move the star rating + review count to immediately below the price (before CTA). Social proof optimization at this position increases conversion by 12-24%.\n\n**Review volume target:** 50+ reviews per Kit. Displaying 50+ reviews increases conversion by 4.6x. Prioritize the review collection flow in post-purchase emails (Deliverable 12).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Checkout Funnel Optimization\n\nDeliverable 10 established a solid 3-step checkout (Contact → Shipping → Payment) with guest-first flow. These additions target the specific friction points where revenue leaks.\n\n### 3.1 Mobile Wallets — One-Click Checkout\n\n**Current (Deliverable 10):** Card, Afterpay, Klarna shown as payment tabs.\n\n**Enhanced:**\n\n| Wallet | Priority | Why |\n|--------|----------|-----|\n| **Shop Pay** | Critical — add to PDP + cart + checkout | Shopify's native one-click. Pre-fills everything for returning Shopify ecosystem users. Highest conversion lift on Shopify stores. |\n| **Apple Pay** | Critical — add as express checkout button | 55%+ of Australian mobile users on iOS. Bypasses all form fields. |\n| **Google Pay** | High — add as express checkout button | Covers Android users. Combined with Apple Pay, captures ~95% of mobile wallets. |\n| **Afterpay** | Keep — prominently displayed | Already in Deliverable 10. \"$25/fortnight\" framing is correct. BNPL visibility boosts checkout completion by 8-19%. |\n\n**Implementation:** Add express checkout buttons (Shop Pay / Apple Pay / Google Pay) in TWO locations:\n1. **Mini-cart slide-out** — before the customer even reaches checkout\n2. **Top of checkout page** — above the form fields\n\nOne-click checkout options reduce cart abandonment by approximately 31%.\n\n### 3.2 Cart Page Optimization\n\n**Current (Deliverable 10):** Cart page not wireframed separately (goes straight to checkout).\n\n**Add a dedicated cart page/slide-out with:**\n\n| Element | Purpose |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Free shipping progress bar** | \"Add $50 more and shipping is on us\" — reduces abandonment by 15-23% |\n| **Express checkout buttons** | Shop Pay / Apple Pay / Google Pay before \"Proceed to Checkout\" |\n| **\"Complete Your Kit\" upsell** | If customer has a single piece, suggest the Kit. If they have a Kit, suggest the Eclipse Layer. |\n| **Estimated delivery date** | \"Arrives by [date]\" — reduces uncertainty anxiety |\n| **60-day guarantee reminder** | Subtle text below total: \"Not sure? You have 60 days to decide.\" |\n\n### 3.3 Payment Failure Recovery\n\n**Not covered in Deliverable 10 — new addition.**\n\n2-5% of transactions fail (expired cards, insufficient funds, processor errors). Without recovery:\n- At 320 orders/month (target), that's 6-16 lost orders = $600-$1,600/month\n\n| Recovery Mechanism | Implementation |\n|-------------------|---------------|\n| **Automatic retry** | Shopify handles basic retry. Ensure Shopify Payments is configured with automatic retry for soft declines. |\n| **Failed payment email** | Automated email within 1 hour: \"Your Kit is ready when you are — here's a direct link to complete your order.\" NOT a generic error. |\n| **Alternative payment prompt** | If card fails, surface \"Try Apple Pay or Afterpay instead\" on the error screen |\n| **Address validation** | Integrate address autocomplete (Google Places API or Australia Post API) to reduce failed deliveries by 10-15% |\n\n### 3.4 Checkout Abandonment by Step\n\nUnderstanding where customers drop tells you what to fix:\n\n| Step | Typical Drop-off | Intus Mitigation |\n|------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| **Email entry** | ~20% | \"Join the Circle\" checkbox creates value exchange. Express checkout bypasses entirely. |\n| **Shipping** | ~25% | Show shipping cost on PDP/cart (already free >$150). Address autocomplete reduces fields. |\n| **Payment** | ~55% | This is where most money is lost. Express wallets + BNPL + trust badges at payment = compound fix. |\n\n**Trust badges at payment step:** Add security seals (Norton Secured, PCI Compliant badge, Shopify Secure Checkout) near the \"Complete Your Kit\" button. This simple addition lifts conversions by 10-15%.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mobile-Specific CRO\n\nMobile is where the money is — and where it's being lost.\n\n### 4.1 The Mobile Gap\n\n| Metric | Desktop | Mobile | Gap |\n|--------|---------|--------|-----|\n| **Traffic share** | 30-35% | 65-70% | Mobile dominates |\n| **Conversion rate** | ~3.5% | ~1.5% | Mobile converts 57% lower |\n| **Cart abandonment** | 73.1% | 85.6% | Mobile abandons 17% more |\n\n**Translation for Intus:** If 70% of traffic is mobile but mobile converts at half the rate, closing the mobile gap is worth more than doubling ad spend.\n\n### 4.2 Sticky Add-to-Cart (Critical)\n\n**Current (Deliverable 10):** CTA is in the right-side content panel, positioned after the price.\n\n**Enhancement:** Make the \"Get This Kit\" button **sticky on mobile** — it stays fixed at the bottom of the screen as users scroll through images, reviews, and details.\n\n- **Benchmark:** Sticky CTAs deliver an 18-23% lift in mobile conversions\n- **Success rate:** 75%+ in A/B tests across ecommerce\n- **Implementation:** Bottom-fixed bar with Kit name, price, and \"Get This Kit\" button. Appears after first scroll past the original CTA position.\n\n```\n┌──────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  [sticky bottom bar]                  │\n│  The Reformer Kit  $100  [Get This Kit] │\n└──────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### 4.3 Thumb Zone Layout\n\n**Current (Deliverable 10):** \"Thumb zone CTAs\" mentioned in audience cognitive profile but not mapped.\n\n**Specific thumb zone implementation:**\n\n| Screen Area | Content | Rationale |\n|-------------|---------|-----------|\n| **Bottom 1/3** (easy reach) | Sticky CTA, navigation bar, quick filters | Primary action zone — 75% of thumb interactions happen here |\n| **Middle 1/3** (comfortable) | Product details, reviews, accordions | Reading and browsing zone |\n| **Top 1/3** (stretch required) | Logo, search, cart icon (small targets OK) | Low-frequency interactions only |\n\n**Mobile navigation enhancement:** Simplified category bar (Kits / Women / Men) within thumb zone instead of hamburger menu. Simplified mobile navigation increases products viewed per session by 18-35%.\n\n### 4.4 Mobile Image Gallery\n\n| Feature | Specification |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **Swipe carousel** | Full-width images, swipe between 6-8 shots |\n| **Dot indicators** | Show position in gallery (not numbered) |\n| **Video autoplay** | Muted autoplay for Kit-in-motion video (saves tap) |\n| **Pinch-to-zoom** | Native zoom on tap/pinch for fabric detail |\n| **Gallery height** | 60% of viewport — enough to see product, still shows price below |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Exit-Intent Strategy\n\n**Not covered in Deliverable 10 — new addition.**\n\nTraditional aggressive popups are a top consumer frustration for Gen Z. Intus needs value-based retention, not desperation discounts.\n\n### 5.1 Shipping Threshold Notification (Primary)\n\nInstead of a generic \"Don't go!\" popup, show a progress bar when the user's cursor moves toward the browser close button (desktop) or when they hit the back button (mobile):\n\n> **\"You're $50 away from free shipping — add the Eclipse Layer?\"**\n\nThis addresses the #1 abandonment reason (unexpected costs) while cross-selling. Reduces abandonment by 15-23%.\n\n### 5.2 Kit Quiz Redirect (Secondary)\n\nIf the user hasn't added anything to cart and shows exit intent:\n\n> **\"Not sure which Kit is yours? Take the 30-second quiz →\"**\n\nThis redirects abandoning browsers into the Kit Quiz funnel (Deliverable 10, Section 3.3) rather than losing them entirely. The quiz has a 60%+ completion target and ends with a direct purchase CTA.\n\n### 5.3 What NOT To Do\n\n| Avoid | Why |\n|-------|-----|\n| Discount popups on first visit | Trains customers to wait for discounts. Destroys margin. Contradicts Magician archetype (no discounts — Deliverable 4). |\n| Email capture popup on entry | Gen Z dismisses these reflexively. Capture via Kit Quiz result page or \"Join the Circle\" inline instead. |\n| Multiple overlapping popups | One behavioral trigger maximum per session. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Live Chat & AI Shopping Assistant\n\n**Not covered in Deliverable 10 — new addition.**\n\n86% of consumers now want AI to assist with product research. For premium performance apparel, the top questions are about fit, fabric, and styling.\n\n### 6.1 AI Shopping Assistant Implementation\n\n| Feature | Specification |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **Platform** | Shopify Inbox, Tidio, or Gorgias with AI integration |\n| **Availability** | 24/7 via AI, with human escalation during AU business hours |\n| **Trigger** | Appears after 30 seconds on PDP or when user views size guide (fit intent signal) |\n| **Trained on** | Kit descriptions, size charts, fabric specs, return policy, brand voice (Deliverable 6) |\n\n### 6.2 Key Conversation Flows\n\n| Customer Question | AI Response Approach |\n|-------------------|---------------------|\n| \"How does the Zyra legging fit?\" | Reference size guide + customer reviews at their size. Use Intus fit language: \"The Zyra is Movement Fit — it moves with you without compression. Customers at your size say it feels like a second skin.\" |\n| \"What's the difference between Kits?\" | Mini Kit Quiz within chat — 2 questions → recommendation |\n| \"Can I return if it doesn't fit?\" | 60-day guarantee policy. Link to returns portal. Reassurance: \"Wear it. Live in it. Return if we're wrong.\" |\n| \"Is the fabric see-through?\" | Link to customer review photos + fabric specs. Honest: \"Our Zyra fabric passes the squat test — here's proof from real customers.\" |\n\n### 6.3 Conversion Impact\n\n- AI-assisted shopping experiences can increase revenue significantly for retailers who implement them effectively\n- Primary value for Intus: Reduces sizing uncertainty (the #1 reason for both non-purchase AND returns in performance apparel)\n- **Start with:** Shopify Inbox (free, native) → upgrade to Gorgias or Tidio if volume exceeds 50 conversations/week\n\n---\n\n## 7.
