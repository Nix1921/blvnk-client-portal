However, it's email-only. SMS is entirely missing — and for a DTC brand targeting Gen Z/Millennials, SMS generates significantly higher revenue per recipient than email campaigns ($0.80 vs $0.11 for top performers). This supplement adds the SMS layer, browse abandonment flow, VIP automation, and A/B testing protocol.\n\n---\n\n## 1. SMS Channel Architecture\n\n### 1.1 Platform: Klaviyo (Unified Email + SMS)\n\nIntus already uses Klaviyo for email (Deliverable 12). Adding SMS within the same platform enables:\n- Unified customer profiles (email + SMS behavior in one view)\n- Smart Send rules across channels (prevent over-messaging)\n- Shared segmentation (Kit personas, VIP, US-based apply to both)\n- Simpler compliance management\n\n### 1.2 SMS Compliance Setup\n\n| Requirement | Configuration |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| **Opt-in collection** | Separate SMS consent checkbox at checkout + \"Join the Circle\" popup |\n| **Multi-step popup** | Step 1: Email (lower friction) → Step 2: SMS (\"Unlock first access to new drops via text\") |\n| **TCPA compliance (US)** | Express written consent required. Double opt-in for US subscribers. |\n| **Australian Spam Act** | Commercial SMS requires consent. Include opt-out in every message. |\n| **Quiet hours** | No SMS before 8am or after 9pm in recipient's local timezone |\n| **Unsubscribe** | Every SMS includes \"Reply STOP to unsubscribe\" |\n\n### 1.3 SMS Frequency Rules\n\n| Rule | Specification | Rationale |\n|------|--------------|-----------|\n| **Campaign frequency** | 1-2 SMS campaigns/week | 72% of consumers accept weekly SMS; 45% accept more than once/week |\n| **Total touchpoint cap** | Max 3-5 total communications (Email + SMS) per customer per week | Prevents channel fatigue |\n| **Growth cadence** | Month 1: 1/week → Month 3: 5-8/month (1 to full list + 1 to engaged segments) | Gradual ramp prevents opt-out spikes |\n| **Smart Sending** | ON for campaigns, OFF for first welcome message only | Welcome SMS must be instant for incentive delivery |\n\n---\n\n## 2. SMS Flows (Integrated with Existing Email Flows)\n\n### Flow 1: Welcome Sequence (SMS Layer)\n\n**Supplements Deliverable 12, Flow 1**\n\nThe email welcome sequence stays as-is (3 emails over 7 days). SMS runs alongside:\n\n| Message | Timing | Content | Channel |\n|---------|--------|---------|---------|\n| **SMS 1** | Immediate (same as Email 1) | \"Welcome to the circle. Here's your [incentive if applicable]. Explore your Kit: [link]\" | SMS |\n| Email 1 | Immediate | \"Welcome to Intentional Movement.\" | Email |\n| **SMS 2** | Day 5 (between Email 2 and 3) | \"Still thinking about your Kit? 60 days to decide. No pressure. [link]\" | SMS |\n| Email 2 | Day 3 | \"What do you do between workouts?\" | Email |\n| Email 3 | Day 7 | \"Wear it. Live in it. Return it if we're wrong.\" | Email |\n\n**Key rule:** Smart Sending OFF for SMS 1 (incentive must be instant). ON for all subsequent messages.\n\n**Revenue impact:** Welcome flows are often the single highest revenue driver due to peak engagement from new signups.\n\n### Flow 2: Abandoned Cart (SMS Layer)\n\n**Supplements Deliverable 12, Flow 3**\n\nThe existing 3-email abandoned cart flow (1hr → 24hr → 72hr) stays. Add SMS as the \"closer\":\n\n| Message | Timing | Content | Channel |\n|---------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Email 1 | 1 hour | \"Your Kit is waiting.\" | Email |\n| **SMS 1** | 2 hours | \"Your [Kit Name] is still in your cart. Complete your Kit: [link]\" | SMS |\n| Email 2 | 24 hours | \"60 days. That's our promise.\" | Email |\n| Email 3 | 72 hours | \"Last reminder — then we'll leave you be.\" | Email |\n| **SMS 2** | 48 hours (US only) | \"Still thinking? Remember — 60 days to decide. [link]\" | SMS (one SMS per event for US compliance) |\n\n**Revenue benchmark:** Abandoned cart flows generate an average of $3.65 per recipient — the highest of any automated flow.\n\n**Rule preserved:** No discounts in abandoned cart. The guarantee is the conversion tool.\n\n### Flow 3: Browse Abandonment (NEW — Not in Deliverable 12)\n\nThis flow targets \"window shoppers\" who viewed a product/Kit but didn't add to cart.\n\n| Message | Timing | Content | Channel |\n|---------|--------|---------|---------|\n| **SMS 1** | 2 hours after browse | \"The [Kit Name] is waiting for you. Rated ★★★★★ by our community. [link]\" | SMS |\n| Email 1 | 4 hours after browse | Subject: \"Still thinking about the [Kit Name]?\" — Product image + 2 similar recommendations | Email |\n| Email 2 | 48 hours | \"What [Kit Name] looks like in real life\" — UGC gallery of the browsed Kit | Email |\n\n**Key rules:**\n- Trigger only if the visitor viewed a product page for 30+ seconds AND did not add to cart\n- Do NOT offer discounts — use social proof and UGC instead to protect margins\n- Suppress if visitor enters the Abandoned Cart flow (higher intent takes priority)\n\n**Benchmarks:**\n- Open rate: 30-35%\n- Conversion rate: 3-5%\n\n### Flow 4: Post-Purchase (SMS Layer)\n\n**Supplements Deliverable 12, Flow 4**\n\nAdd SMS touchpoints to the existing 5-email post-purchase sequence:\n\n| Message | Timing | Content | Channel |\n|---------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Email 1 | Immediate | \"Your Kit is on its way.\" | Email |\n| **SMS 1** | Shipping confirmation | \"Your Kit just shipped! Track it here: [link]\" | SMS |\n| **SMS 2** | Delivered (carrier confirmed) | \"Your Kit has arrived. Welcome to Intentional Movement.\" | SMS |\n| Email 2 | Day 3 post-delivery | \"Welcome to Intentional Movement.\" | Email |\n| Email 3 | Day 14 | \"How's The Kit treating you?\" | Email |\n| **SMS 3** | Day 14 (if no review submitted) | \"Love your Kit? Drop a quick review and help someone find theirs: [link]\" | SMS |\n| Email 4 | Day 30 | \"Your Kit has a companion.\" (cross-sell) | Email |\n| Email 5 | Day 55 | \"Your 60-day guarantee is almost up.\" | Email |\n\n### Flow 5: Back-in-Stock Alerts (NEW — Not in Deliverable 12)\n\nCritical for apparel drops where popular sizes and colorways sell out frequently.\n\n| Message | Timing | Content | Channel |\n|---------|--------|---------|---------|\n| **SMS 1** | Immediately on restock | \"The [Kit Name] in [Size/Color] is back. It's waiting for you: [link]\" | SMS (speed is critical for limited inventory) |\n| Email 1 | 30 minutes after SMS | Same notification with Kit imagery and styling suggestions | Email |\n\n**Implementation:** Add \"Notify me when available\" button on out-of-stock PDPs. Collect both email and phone number. Prioritize SMS for the first alert (speed ensures interested customers are notified first).\n\n### Flow 6: Win-Back / Hybrid Reactivation (Enhanced from Deliverable 12, Flow 5)\n\n**Supplements Deliverable 12, Flow 5** — adds SMS for email-inactive subscribers.\n\nThe original reactivation flow (Day 60 → Day 75 → Day 90 sunset) targets email-only. But email-inactive customers may still be SMS-responsive. Use the \"90-day inverse\" segment:\n\n| Segment | Definition | Channel |\n|---------|-----------|---------|\n| **90-day inverse** | No email open/click for 90 days BUT SMS-consented | SMS primary |\n\n| Message | Timing | Content | Channel |\n|---------|--------|---------|---------|\n| **SMS 1** | Day 0 | \"Hey [Name] — it's been a while. We've got some new Kits we think you'll love. [link]\" | SMS (friendly, no hard sell) |\n| Email 1 | Day 2 | Highlight new products or content | Email |\n| **SMS 2** | Day 14 | \"Free shipping on your next Kit — just for you. [link]\" (free shipping, not discount) | SMS |\n| Email 2 | Day 30 | Sunset email: \"Should we keep in touch?\" | Email |\n\n---\n\n## 3. VIP & Loyalty Automation (NEW — Not in Deliverable 12)\n\nDeliverable 12 defined a VIP segment (2+ purchases or $200+ lifetime spend) but didn't automate the VIP experience. Tiered loyalty programs generate 1.8x higher ROI than flat programs.\n\n### 3.1 VIP Tier Structure\n\n| Tier | Trigger | Perks |\n|------|---------|-------|\n| **The Circle** | Email signup | Community content, Movement Philosophy |\n| **Kit Owner** | First purchase | Post-purchase flow, Kit persona content, review invitations |\n| **Inner Circle** | 2+ purchases OR $200+ spend | Early access to new colorways, founder updates, exclusive content |\n| **Movement Maker** | 5+ purchases OR $500+ spend | First access to new Kits, surprise gifts, brand event invitations, behind-the-scenes |\n\n### 3.2 VIP Trigger Automations\n\n| Trigger | Message | Channel |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| Customer reaches Inner Circle | \"You've officially joined our Inner Circle. Here's what that means for you...\" + perks list | Email (rich content) + SMS (celebration alert) |\n| Customer reaches Movement Maker | Personal message from founder + exclusive perk | Email + SMS |\n| VIP hasn't purchased in 60 days | \"We've been saving something for you\" + early access to next drop | SMS |\n| New colorway/Kit launching | Inner Circle + Movement Maker get 48-hour early access link | SMS (first access alert) → Email (detail) |\n\n### 3.3 Loyalty Economics\n\n| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |\n|--------|--------|---------------|\n| **VIP purchase frequency** | 3.6x more than non-members | Industry benchmark for successful tier programs |\n| **VIP AOV** | 25%+ higher than standard customers | Status + exclusivity drives larger baskets |\n| **Repeat purchase rate** | >15% within 90 days (from Deliverable 1) | VIP automation accelerates this toward 25%+ |\n\n**Important:** Intus does NOT discount (Magician archetype rule from Deliverable 4). VIP perks are **access** and **experience** — never price cuts:\n- Early access to drops (48-hour window)\n- Exclusive colorways\n- Founder content and behind-the-scenes\n- Brand event invitations\n- Surprise gifts (branded accessories, coffee cups from product range)\n\n---\n\n## 4. List Growth Strategy\n\n### 4.1 Growth Velocity Targets\n\n| Metric | Target | Benchmark |\n|--------|--------|-----------|\n| **Popup form submit rate** | >3% | Industry benchmark for popup conversion |\n| **Monthly list growth (email)** | 3-5% net growth | Healthy for early-stage DTC |\n| **Monthly list growth (SMS)** | 2-3% net growth | SMS grows slower (higher friction) but higher value |\n| **Checkout SMS opt-in rate** | >15% | Capture high-intent buyers already entering details |\n\n### 4.2 Collection Points\n\n| Touchpoint | Mechanism | Incentive |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Homepage popup** | Multi-step: Email (Step 1) → SMS (Step 2) | Email: \"Join the Circle\" / SMS: \"Unlock first access to new drops\" |\n| **Kit Quiz result** | Collect email + phone to \"save your Kit result\" | Personalized Kit recommendation saved |\n| **Checkout** | SMS consent checkbox (pre-checked OFF for compliance) | \"Get shipping updates + early access via text\" |\n| **Post-purchase** | Email asks for SMS consent | \"Want text updates for your next Kit drop?\" |\n| **Instagram/TikTok** | Link-in-bio to SMS keyword (e.g., text INTUS to [number]) | \"Text us for early access\" |\n\n### 4.3 Multi-Step Popup Implementation\n\n```\nStep 1 (Low friction):\n┌──────────────────────────────┐\n│  JOIN THE CIRCLE              │\n│                              │\n│  Get the Movement Philosophy  │\n│  + early access to new Kits   │\n│                              │\n│  Email: [________________]    │\n│  [Join the Circle →]         │\n└──────────────────────────────┘\n\nStep 2 (After email submitted):\n┌──────────────────────────────┐\n│  WANT FIRST ACCESS?          │\n│                              │\n│  Inner Circle members get     │\n│  new drops 48 hours early     │\n│  via text.                    │\n│                              │\n│  Phone: [________________]    │\n│  [Yes, text me →]            │\n│  [No thanks]                 │\n└──────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. A/B Testing Protocol\n\n### 5.1 Test Priority Order (What to Test First)\n\nTest these variables in this specific order to maximize impact:\n\n| Priority | Variable | Test Setup | Why First |\n|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **1** | SMS vs MMS | Standard text vs. image-included message for Kit alerts | 95% of tests show SMS outperforms MMS in conversion — but Intus is a highly visual brand, so validate specifically |\n| **2** | Send time | Morning (8-9am) vs. evening (6-7pm) for campaigns | Find the \"phone-in-hand\" window for the 18-35 audience |\n| **3** | Subject lines (email) | Question vs. statement vs. personalized (Kit name) | Highest-volume, lowest-risk test. Run continuously. |\n| **4** | CTA language | \"Get Your Kit\" vs. \"Complete Your Kit\" vs. \"Explore\" | Directly impacts click-through rate |\n| **5** | Flow timing | Test 1hr vs 2hr vs 4hr for abandoned cart SMS | Find the optimal response window |\n\n### 5.2 Testing Rules\n\n| Rule | Specification |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Minimum sample size** | 1,000 recipients per variant (wait for statistical significance) |\n| **Test duration** | Minimum 7 days (covers all day-of-week variation) |\n| **One variable at a time** | Never test subject + send time + content simultaneously |\n| **Winner criteria** | Revenue per recipient, not just open rate. Opens are vanity; RPR is the money metric. |\n| **Roll-out** | When winner is confirmed (95% confidence), apply to 100% of segment. Move to next test. |\n\n### 5.3 Key Benchmarks to Beat (Apparel & Accessories, Top 10%)\n\n| Metric | Email Target | SMS Target |\n|--------|-------------|-----------|\n| **Click rate** | >3.5% (from Deliverable 12) | >16.6% |\n| **Revenue per recipient** | >$0.11 (campaign average) | >$0.80 |\n| **Placed order rate** | Track baseline | >0.59% per campaign |\n| **Unsubscribe rate** | <0.3% (from Deliverable 12) | <0.35% per send |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Updated KPI Dashboard\n\nExtends Deliverable 12, Section 5 with SMS metrics:\n\n| Metric | Email Target | SMS Target | Action if Below |\n|--------|-------------|-----------|----------------|\n| **Open rate** | >25% | N/A (SMS doesn't track opens) | Subject line test, sender check |\n| **Click rate** | >3.5% | >16.6% | Content relevance, CTA test |\n| **Revenue per recipient** | >$0.11 | >$0.80 | Segmentation, offer relevance |\n| **Unsubscribe rate** | <0.3% | <0.35% | Frequency check, value audit |\n| **Spam complaint rate** | <0.1% | N/A | List hygiene, authentication |\n| **List growth (monthly)** | 3-5% net | 2-3% net | Popup optimization, new collection points |\n| **SMS opt-in rate (checkout)** | — | >15% | Consent copy test, incentive test |\n| **Abandoned cart recovery** | Track | $3.65 RPR benchmark | Flow timing, guarantee messaging |\n\n---\n\n## 7.
