  "rawMarkdown": "# Channel Benchmarks & Paid Acquisition Playbook — Intus Ecommerce Supplement\n**Supplements:** Deliverable 13 (Ad Creative Testing Framework)\n**Department:** Distribution & Growth Engine\n**Intelligence Source:** Ecommerce Acquisition Notebook (2025 benchmarks)\n**Date:** February 2026\n\n---\n\n## Why This Supplement Exists\n\nDeliverable 13 built a strong 3-phase testing framework (Pre-Flight → New vs. BAU → Scaling) with clear decision rules and creative concepts. However, it lacked 2025 channel-specific benchmarks — what does \"good\" look like on Meta vs. TikTok vs. Google for DTC activewear? When should you switch from first-purchase to LTV bidding? How fast do you need to produce new creative? This supplement provides the benchmarks and channel economics that turn the testing framework into a calibrated acquisition machine.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The 2025 Paid Acquisition Landscape\n\n### What's Changed Since the Original Deliverable\n\n| Shift | Impact on Intus |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **AI-powered campaign types dominate** | Meta Advantage+ and Google PMax are now the default. Manual targeting is a fallback, not a strategy. |\n| **Creative is the new targeting** | Algorithms go broad. Your ad creative qualifies the audience, not interest targeting. |\n| **UGC outperforms studio content** | UGC in Facebook ads delivers 4x higher CTR and 50% lower CPC than standard creative |\n| **Signal quality determines success** | Without server-side tracking (CAPI), you're flying blind. Pixel-only data loses 30-40% of conversions. |\n| **Agentic commerce is emerging** | 23% of Americans have made AI-assisted purchases. Prepare product data for AI agent crawling. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Channel-Specific Benchmarks\n\n### 2.1 Meta (Instagram + Facebook) — Primary Channel\n\n**Budget allocation (from Deliverable 13):** 50% of paid budget\n\n| Metric | DTC Activewear Benchmark (2025) | Intus Target | Notes |\n|--------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------|\n| **Prospecting CAC** | $25-40 AUD (fashion category) | <$30 AUD | $30 = break-even at 30% margin on $100 Kit |\n| **Retargeting CAC** | $10-20 AUD | <$15 AUD | Warm audiences from Kit Quiz + site visitors |\n| **CTR (UGC creative)** | 1.2-1.8% (avg), 4x lift with UGC | >2.0% with UGC | UGC is non-negotiable for Intus (Gen Z trust) |\n| **CPC** | 50% lower with UGC vs. standard | Track and optimize | Don't optimize for CPC directly — optimize for CPA |\n| **nROAS** | 2-3x prospecting, 5-8x retargeting | >3x blended nROAS | nROAS = New Customer Revenue / Ad Spend |\n\n**Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns (ASC+) Playbook:**\n\n| Setting | Recommendation | Why |\n|---------|---------------|-----|\n| **Targeting** | Broad (no interest targeting) | ASC+ uses AI to find your audience. Restricting it increases costs. Let the creative qualify the audience. |\n| **Creative volume** | 5-10 creatives per campaign | Algorithm needs variation to test. More creative = more signals. |\n| **Budget** | Start at $50-100/day, scale 20-30% every 3-4 days | Gradual scaling preserves learning. Sudden jumps reset the algorithm. |\n| **Exclusions** | Exclude existing customers from ASC+ | Prevents paying to acquire customers who would've bought anyway. This is the #1 mistake. |\n| **Branded search cannibalization** | Run a separate manual campaign for retargeting | ASC+ should be purely new customer acquisition |\n\n**Creative performance hierarchy for Intus:**\n\n| Creative Type | Expected Performance | Use Case |\n|--------------|---------------------|----------|\n| **UGC testimonial** (direct-to-camera) | Highest CTR, lowest CPC | \"I wore this Kit for 12 hours straight\" — real customer, real day |\n| **Day-in-the-life video** | High engagement, strong brand lift | POV transition content (studio → coffee → evening) |\n| **Product showcase with context** | Reliable CPA, consistent ROAS | Kit photography in lifestyle setting (not white background) |\n| **Text-forward/typography** | Lower engagement, higher qualified clicks | \"Your day is 24 hours. Your workout is 1.\" — filters for intent |\n\n### 2.2 TikTok — Discovery Channel\n\n**Budget allocation (from Deliverable 13):** 30% of paid budget\n\n| Metric | DTC Benchmark (2025) | Intus Target | Notes |\n|--------|---------------------|-------------|-------|\n| **Prospecting CAC** | $30-50 AUD (higher cold traffic cost) | <$45 AUD | TikTok has higher CPMs but lower funnel intent. Accept higher CAC for brand building. |\n| **Creative refresh cycle** | Every 2-3 weeks (faster than Meta) | 2-week refresh minimum | TikTok audiences fatigue faster. Format: native, not polished. |\n| **Hook rate** | 30%+ (% who watch past 3 seconds) | >35% | \"What do you do between workouts?\" = strong hook |\n\n**TikTok-specific strategy:**\n\n| Tactic | Implementation |\n|--------|---------------|\n| **Creative velocity** | 5-7 new concepts per week across platforms (AI-assisted research + production). Top brands maintain this cadence. 85.7% of DTC advertisers already use AI for creative research. |\n| **TikTok Shop** | Enable TikTok Shop when available in AU. In-platform checkout reduces friction. Fashion brands seeing strong early results. |\n| **Spark Ads** | Boost organic UGC posts as ads. Preserves authenticity. Lower CPMs than standard ads. |\n| **Creator partnerships** | Partner with 3-5 micro-creators (10K-100K followers) in fitness/lifestyle. Creator content as ads outperforms brand content. |\n| **Content style** | Phone-shot, talking-to-camera, \"day with me\" format. Do NOT run polished Meta ads on TikTok. |\n\n**Decision: When to increase TikTok budget:**\n- If TikTok-sourced customers show higher LTV (check after 90 days)\n- If branded search volume increases when TikTok spend increases (halo effect)\n- If creative costs are lower on TikTok (UGC creators vs. professional shoots)\n\n### 2.3 Google (Shopping + PMax) — Intent Channel\n\n**Budget allocation (from Deliverable 13):** Not originally allocated (YouTube at 10% only)\n\n**Recommendation:** Add Google Shopping at 10% of budget (take from testing reserve or scale overall budget)\n\n| Metric | DTC Benchmark (2025) | Intus Target | Notes |\n|--------|---------------------|-------------|-------|\n| **Non-branded CAC** | $20-35 AUD | <$25 AUD | High-intent searchers (\"reformer pilates leggings\") |\n| **Branded CAC** | $3-8 AUD | Track but don't celebrate | These customers were already looking for you |\n| **Search conversion rate** | 2-5% (non-branded), 8-15% (branded) | >3% non-branded | Organic search converts 13% better than AI referrals |\n\n**Google PMax critical rule:**\n\n> **Exclude branded search terms from Performance Max campaigns.**\n\nPMax will eagerly spend budget on branded searches (people already searching \"Intus activewear\") and report inflated ROAS. This is not incremental — these customers would have found you anyway. Run branded search as a separate manual campaign with minimal budget.\n\n**Google Shopping feed optimization for Intus:**\n\n| Field | Optimization |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **Product title** | \"[Kit Name] — [Key Benefit] | Intus\" e.g., \"The Reformer Kit — Activewear for Your Full Day | Intus\" |\n| **Description** | Lead with benefit, not features. \"One outfit from studio to street.\" |\n| **Images** | Lifestyle image primary (Kit on person), not white background |\n| **Product type** | Activewear > Sets > [Kit Name] (specific categorization for algorithm) |\n| **Custom labels** | Kit vs. Individual, Price tier, New vs. Evergreen |\n\n### 2.4 Emerging Channels to Test (Month 3+)\n\nOnly test after Meta + TikTok + Google are profitable and scaling.\n\n| Channel | Budget | When to Test | Why |\n|---------|--------|-------------|-----|\n| **YouTube Shorts ads** | 5% | Month 3 | Repurpose TikTok/Reels content. Growing audience. Bridge between social discovery and search intent. |\n| **AppLovin** | 5% | Month 4 | High reach, affordable CPMs compared to Meta. Gaining DTC traction. |\n| **Connected TV (CTV)** | Test only | Month 6+ | Growing +13.8% in 2025. Requires higher production value. Better for brand building than direct response. |\n| **Agentic Commerce prep** | $0 (operational) | Now | Ensure product data is structured for AI agents (clean titles, descriptions, schema markup). 23% of Americans already using AI for purchases. By 2030: 10-20% of US ecommerce. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. First-Purchase vs. LTV-Optimized Bidding\n\n### 3.1 The Shift\n\n| Phase | Bidding Strategy | When |\n|-------|-----------------|------|\n| **Month 1-3** (Launch) | First-purchase optimized | Optimize for purchase conversions. Goal: build pixel data, find winning creative, establish CAC baseline. |\n| **Month 4-6** (Growth) | Hybrid | Run first-purchase campaigns for prospecting + value-based bidding for retargeting. Start feeding LTV data to platforms. |\n| **Month 7+** (Scale) | LTV-optimized | Optimize for high-value customers, not just any purchase. Platforms need 50+ conversions/week minimum for LTV bidding to work. |\n\n### 3.2 Why This Matters for Intus\n\n| Customer Type | First Purchase | Conversion Rate | Repeat Rate |\n|---------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| **New prospect** | $100 Kit | 5-20% | Unknown |\n| **Loyal customer** | $100+ (Kit + Layer) | 60-70% | Predictable |\n\nLoyal customers convert at 60-70% vs. 5-20% for new prospects. Once you have 90 days of data, shift budget toward acquiring customers who look like your best repeat buyers — not just anyone who'll buy once.\n\n### 3.3 LTV Data Pipeline\n\n| Step | Implementation | Timeline |\n|------|---------------|----------|\n| 1. Track repeat purchases | Klaviyo + Shopify cohort reports | Month 1 (start tracking immediately) |\n| 2. Calculate LTV by acquisition source | Which channel brings the highest-LTV customers? | Month 3 (need 90 days of data) |\n| 3. Feed LTV data to Meta | Custom conversion values in CAPI (e.g., \"high-value customer\" = $300 LTV) | Month 4 |\n| 4. Switch to value-based bidding | Tell Meta to optimize for $300 LTV customers, not just any $100 purchase | Month 6 |\n\n### 3.4 LTV Economics for Intus\n\n| Metric | Target | Benchmark |\n|--------|--------|-----------|\n| **LTV:CAC ratio** | >3:1 minimum, 5:1 excellent | <2:1 is unsustainable (burning cash). >5:1 means under-investing. |\n| **CAC payback period** | <3 months | Healthy: 3-6 months. Elite: first-order profitable. Warning: >12 months. |\n| **Second purchase timing** | 60-90 days | Average for activewear. Post-purchase flow (Deliverable 12) targets Day 30 cross-sell. |\n| **12-month LTV** | $200-300 (2-3 purchases) | Driven by Kit expansion (new Kits, Layers, accessories) |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Creative Velocity Requirements\n\n### 4.1 The New Reality\n\nIn 2025, creative is the primary targeting lever. Algorithms go broad — your ad creative is what qualifies the audience. This means you need a production machine, not a production schedule.\n\n| Metric | Target | Why |\n|--------|--------|-----|\n| **New concepts per week** | 5-7 across all platforms | Top DTC brands maintain this cadence. Creative fatigue is the #1 performance killer. |\n| **Creative refresh cycle** | 2-3 weeks per platform | TikTok fatigues fastest (2 weeks), Meta lasts slightly longer (3-4 weeks as per Deliverable 13) |\n| **Active creatives per scaling campaign** | 3-5 minimum | Never rely on a single ad. Diversity protects against fatigue spikes. |\n| **AI assistance** | Mandatory | 85.7% of DTC advertisers use AI for creative research, 78.6% for production |\n\n### 4.2 Creative Production System for Intus\n\n**Monthly output target: 20-28 new creative assets**\n\n| Source | Volume | Cost | Quality |\n|--------|--------|------|---------|\n| **UGC from customers** | 5-10/month (from #MyIntusKit, review photos) | Free (incentivized by post-purchase flow) | Highest trust, lowest production value — perfect for TikTok/Reels |\n| **Creator partnerships** | 5-8/month (3-5 micro-creators) | $200-500/creator/month | Authentic voice, professional quality, platform-native |\n| **Internal production** | 5-10/month (phone-shot, founder content) | Staff time only | Brand storytelling, behind-the-scenes, transition POVs |\n| **AI-generated variations** | Unlimited (copy variants, hook tests) | Tool subscription ($50-100/month) | A/B test hooks, CTAs, and copy angles at scale |\n\n### 4.3 Creative Brief Template (for creators)\n\nFor each concept, provide:\n\n```\nCONCEPT: [Name]\nHOOK (first 3 seconds): [The line/visual that stops the scroll]\nBODY (10-20 seconds): [The narrative or demonstration]\nCTA (final 3-5 seconds): [Action + offer]\nPLATFORM: [TikTok / Meta / Both]\nARCHETYPE: [Magician / Sage]\nDO: [Transition moments, real life, UGC-style]\nDON'T: [Gym interiors, discounts, \"Shop Now\" CTA, polished studio]\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Signal Quality & Server-Side Tracking\n\n### 5.1 Why This Is Critical\n\nWithout proper signal quality, your platforms are bidding blind. After iOS14, browser-based pixels lose 30-40% of conversion data.\n\n| Implementation | Status | Priority |\n|---------------|--------|----------|\n| **Meta Conversions API (CAPI)** | REQUIRED | Critical — without this, Meta can't optimize properly |\n| **Google Enhanced Conversions** | REQUIRED | Critical — feeds accurate data to PMax |\n| **TikTok Events API** | REQUIRED | High — same signal loss problem as Meta |\n| **Shopify server-side events** | REQUIRED | Foundation — Shopify → GA4 via Measurement Protocol |\n| **First-party data collection** | Ongoing | Essential — 92% of brands call first-party data \"essential\" in 2025 |\n\n### 5.2 Implementation Priority\n\n1. **Week 1:** Enable Shopify server-side tracking → GA4 Measurement Protocol\n2. **Week 1:** Set up Meta CAPI through Shopify's native integration\n3. **Week 2:** Enable Google Enhanced Conversions in Shopify\n4. **Week 2:** Set up TikTok Events API\n5. **Week 3:** Validate data accuracy (server-side should match Shopify orders within 90%)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Updated Budget Allocation (Revised from Deliverable 13)\n\n### Launch Month (Month 1): $2,500-3,500 AUD\n\n| Channel | % | Budget | Purpose |\n|---------|---|--------|---------|\n| **Meta (IG + FB)** | 45% | $1,125-1,575 | ASC+ prospecting + manual retargeting. Kit Quiz traffic. |\n| **TikTok** | 25% | $625-875 | Discovery + Spark Ads. UGC amplification. |\n| **Google Shopping** | 15% | $375-525 | Non-branded product searches. High-intent capture. |\n| **Testing reserve** | 15% | $375-525 | Phase 1 Pre-Flight, Runoff testing, emerging channel tests. |\n\n### Growth Phase (Month 3-6): $5,000-8,000 AUD\n\n| Channel | % | Budget | Purpose |\n|---------|---|--------|---------|\n| **Meta** | 40% | $2,000-3,200 | Scale winners. Value-based bidding (Month 4+). |\n| **TikTok** | 25% | $1,250-2,000 | Scale + TikTok Shop (when available). |\n| **Google** | 20% | $1,000-1,600 | Shopping + non-branded search expansion. |\n| **YouTube Shorts** | 5% | $250-400 | Repurposed creative testing. |\n| **Testing/Emerging** | 10% | $500-800 | AppLovin test, CTV test. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Decision Framework: When to Scale vs. Pull Back\n\n| Signal | Action |\n|--------|--------|\n| nROAS >3x for 7+ consecutive days | Scale budget 20-30% |\n| CAC <$30 and stable for 2 weeks | Scale budget, expand to new audiences |\n| CAC rising >30% for 3+ days | Rotate creative first. If CAC doesn't drop, reduce budget. |\n| CTR declining 3+ days | Creative fatigue. Launch new Pre-Flight batch. |\n| Branded search volume increasing while TikTok spend increases | TikTok halo effect confirmed. Don't cut TikTok based on last-click attribution. |\n| nROAS <2x for 2+ weeks | Channel economics don't work. Reallocate to higher-performing channel. |\n\n---\n\n*Supplement S03 of 5 — Intus Ecommerce Intelligence Layer*\n*Supplements Deliverable 13: Ad Creative Testing Framework*\n"
