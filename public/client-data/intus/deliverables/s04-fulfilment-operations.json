  "rawMarkdown": "# Fulfilment & Operations Playbook — Intus Ecommerce Supplement\n**Supplements:** No original deliverable (new coverage area)\n**Department:** Distribution & Growth Engine\n**Intelligence Source:** Ecommerce Operations Notebook (2025 benchmarks)\n**Date:** February 2026\n\n---\n\n## Why This Supplement Exists\n\nThe Intus Launch Kit covers brand strategy, creative, digital architecture, and distribution. But it contains zero coverage of fulfilment, shipping, returns, or inventory management. For a DTC Intentional Movement brand with physical products shipping to Australia and the USA, operations strategy directly impacts margin, customer experience, and scalability. This playbook fills that gap — especially critical given the August 2025 US de minimis duty repeal that changes international shipping economics.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Fulfilment Architecture: Current State & Roadmap\n\n### 1.1 Phase Model\n\n| Phase | Order Volume | Fulfilment Model | When |\n|-------|-------------|-----------------|------|\n| **Phase 1: Startup** | 0-100 orders/month | Self-fulfil or micro-3PL | Now |\n| **Phase 2: Growth** | 100-500 orders/month | Australian 3PL | Month 3-6 |\n| **Phase 3: Scale** | 500+ orders/month (200+ to US) | AU 3PL + US 3PL hub | Month 6-12 |\n\n### 1.2 When to Move from Self-Fulfil to 3PL\n\nSwitch when ANY of these are true:\n- Spending >15 hours/week on packing and shipping\n- Order accuracy dropping below 99%\n- Missing same-day dispatch cutoffs regularly\n- Unable to process returns within 48 hours\n- Growth is being limited by operational capacity\n\n---\n\n## 2. 3PL Selection (Phase 2)\n\n### 2.1 Selection Criteria for 100-500 Orders/Month\n\nAt this volume, you're in a \"dead zone\" — too big for a garage, too small for leverage with major 3PLs. Prioritize technology integration and scalability over raw price per pick.\n\n| Criteria | Minimum Standard | Why It Matters |\n|----------|-----------------|---------------|\n| **Pick/pack accuracy** | 99.5%+ | Errors cost $10-15 per incident (re-ship + return processing). At 1% error rate on 300 orders = 3 errors/month = $30-45 wasted. |\n| **Same-day dispatch SLA** | Orders before 2pm AEST dispatched same day | Consumer expectation in 2025: ~3.1 days click-to-door. Same-day dispatch is the only way to hit this. |\n| **Shopify integration** | Native/real-time sync | Real-time inventory visibility prevents overselling. Non-negotiable. |\n| **Returns processing** | Accept and process returns within 48 hours | 60-day guarantee means returns will happen. Fast processing = fast restocking. |\n| **Scalability** | Can handle 3x current volume without renegotiation | Black Friday, launch spikes, viral moments. Don't get locked into a capacity ceiling. |\n| **Reporting** | Real-time dashboard (orders, inventory, returns) | You need visibility to make decisions. Monthly reports aren't enough. |\n\n### 2.2 Australian 3PL Options to Evaluate\n\n| Provider Type | Pros | Cons | Best For |\n|--------------|------|------|----------|\n| **Melbourne-based micro-3PL** | Local to Intus HQ, easy oversight, flexible | Limited tech, may not scale | Phase 2 (100-300 orders) |\n| **National 3PL** (e.g., ShipBob AU, Sendle Fulfilment) | Tech-forward, Shopify native, multi-warehouse | Higher minimums, less personal | Phase 2-3 (300+ orders) |\n| **Shopify Fulfillment Network** | Native integration, designed for Shopify brands | Availability/coverage varies | Evaluate when available in AU |\n\n### 2.3 Key Contract Terms to Negotiate\n\n| Term | What to Push For |\n|------|-----------------|\n| **No minimum order commitment** | Early-stage volume fluctuates. Don't lock in 500/month minimums. |\n| **Transparent pricing** | Per-pick, per-pack, per-ship clearly broken out. No \"handling fees\" that balloon. |\n| **Exit clause** | 30-day exit notice maximum. You need flexibility to switch. |\n| **Peak surcharge cap** | Black Friday/Christmas surcharges capped at 20% above standard rates. |\n| **Returns processing included** | Some 3PLs charge extra per return. Negotiate this into the base rate. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Shipping Strategy\n\n### 3.1 Domestic (Australia)\n\n| Tier | Delivery Time | Cost to Customer | Cost to Intus (est.) | When to Offer |\n|------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|\n| **Standard** | 3-5 business days | FREE over $150 AUD / $9.95 under | $8-12 per order | Default option |\n| **Express** | 1-2 business days | $14.95 AUD | $12-18 per order | Optional upgrade |\n\n**Free shipping threshold:** $150 AUD (already set in Deliverable 10). This is correctly positioned just above the Kit AOV ($100) to incentivize Kit + accessory purchases.\n\n**Shipping cost as % of AOV:**\n\n| Scenario | Shipping Cost | AOV | % of AOV | Status |\n|----------|-------------|-----|----------|--------|\n| Kit purchase ($100) below threshold | $8-12 (Intus pays) if free / customer pays $9.95 | $100 | 8-12% | Acceptable |\n| Kit + accessory ($150+) free shipping | $8-12 (Intus absorbs) | $150+ | 5-8% | Good — within 10% target |\n| Express upgrade | Customer pays $14.95 | $100+ | 0% to Intus | Profit-positive |\n\n**Target:** Keep total logistics costs (fulfilment + shipping) below 20-25% of AOV. Monitor this monthly.\n\n### 3.2 International (Australia → United States)\n\n**CRITICAL: US De Minimis Duty Repeal (August 2025)**\n\nAs of August 29, 2025, the US has suspended the de minimis duty-free treatment for shipments under $800. This fundamentally changes Intus's US shipping economics:\n\n| Before Aug 2025 | After Aug 2025 |\n|-----------------|---------------|\n| Ship a $100 Kit from Melbourne → LA **duty-free** | Same package now subject to **duties + formal customs entry** |\n| Simple, fast customs clearance | Potential customs delays + brokerage fees |\n| No surprise costs for US customer | Customer may face unexpected duties at delivery |\n\n### 3.3 US Shipping Strategy (Revised)\n\n**Phase 1: Direct Ship from AU (Now — while US volume is <200 orders/month)**\n\n| Element | Setup |\n|---------|-------|\n| **Shipping method** | DHL Express or Australia Post International from Melbourne |\n| **Delivery time** | 5-10 business days |\n| **Duties handling** | DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) — Intus pays duties upfront so customer has no surprise costs |\n| **Cost to Intus** | $25-40 AUD per order (shipping + duties + brokerage) |\n| **Customer price** | $19.95 USD flat rate (absorb remaining cost as marketing expense) |\n\n**Why DDP:** \"Surprise\" duties at delivery = instant customer rage + high return rate. Always prepay duties for US customers. Build the cost into your US pricing or absorb it as customer acquisition cost.\n\n**Phase 2: US Fulfilment Hub (When US volume exceeds 200 orders/month)**\n\n| Element | Setup |\n|---------|-------|\n| **Strategy** | Bulk import inventory by freight (sea or air) to a US 3PL warehouse |\n| **Benefits** | Domestic US shipping (2-5 days), no per-package duties, lower shipping cost ($5-8 per order) |\n| **Trigger** | 200+ consistent US orders/month for 2+ consecutive months |\n| **3PL options** | ShipBob US, Deliverr, or any Shopify-integrated US 3PL |\n| **Inventory risk** | Must commit to US-based inventory. Start with top-selling SKUs only (Reformer Kit, Street Kit). |\n\n**Timeline decision point:** Review US volume monthly. When US orders hit 150+/month with upward trend, start 3PL onboarding (takes 4-6 weeks to set up).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Returns Management\n\n### 4.1 Return Rate Benchmarks\n\n| Metric | Industry Average | Intus Target | Strategy to Achieve |\n|--------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| **Overall return rate** | 16.9% (retail avg), 20-30% (apparel DTC) | <18% | Fit tools, UGC, detailed size guides |\n| **Size-related returns** | 50-60% of all apparel returns | <40% (with fit tools) | Fit predictor reduces by 12-18% (S01 CRO Playbook) |\n| **Return processing cost** | $10-15 per return | Minimize through self-service | Automated return portal reduces support time |\n\n### 4.2 Return Processing Flow\n\n```\nCustomer initiates return\n    ↓\nSelf-service portal (Loop Returns or Shopify native)\n    ↓\nReason selection (Size too small / Size too big / Didn't like fit / Quality / Other)\n    ↓\nReturn label generated → Customer ships\n    ↓\n[DATA: Feed reason codes back to product team]\n    ↓\nItem received at warehouse\n    ↓\nQuality check (48-hour SLA)\n    ↓\nRefund processed → Customer notified\n```\n\n### 4.3 Return Reduction Strategies (Specific to Intus)\n\n| Strategy | Expected Impact | Implementation |\n|----------|----------------|---------------|\n| **Fit predictor tool** | -12-18% size returns | See S01 CRO Playbook, Section 2.2 |\n| **Customer photo reviews with size info** | -10-15% fit uncertainty | Post-purchase flow requests \"What size did you order? How does it fit?\" |\n| **Detailed size guide with body measurements** | -5-10% size returns | Currently in Deliverable 10 trust gap section — upgrade to interactive tool |\n| **Interactive fit guide** | Reduces unknown-fit anxiety | Add to PDP: height + weight + preferred fit inputs → personalised recommendation (see S01 CRO Playbook, Section 2.2) |\n| **Lifestyle photos showing fit on diverse bodies** | Reduces \"looked different online\" returns | Shoot models across size range (XS-XL minimum) |\n\n### 4.4 60-Day Guarantee Economics\n\nIntus's 60-day guarantee is a category-defining trust signal and conversion tool (Deliverable 4 — Magician archetype). But it needs financial monitoring:\n\n| Metric | Monitor Monthly | Warning Threshold |\n|--------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **Return rate** | % of orders returned | >20% triggers investigation |\n| **Return timing** | When in the 60-day window do returns happen? | If >50% return in days 30-60, the policy may be encouraging \"try and return\" |\n| **Return cost per order** | Total return costs / Total orders | >5% of revenue triggers review |\n| **Net margin after returns** | Revenue - COGS - Shipping - Returns | Must remain positive |\n\n**Important:** The 60-day guarantee may increase return rates by 5-10% vs. a 30-day policy. This is the cost of the conversion lift it provides. Monitor the trade-off: if the conversion lift (more orders) exceeds the cost of additional returns, keep it.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Inventory Management\n\n### 5.1 Key Metrics\n\n| Metric | Target | Definition |\n|--------|--------|-----------|\n| **Inventory turnover** | 4-6x per year (apparel DTC benchmark) | COGS / Average Inventory. Higher = healthier cash flow. |\n| **Weeks of cover** | 8-12 weeks | How many weeks of sales the current inventory covers. Below 6 = stockout risk. Above 16 = cash tied up. |\n| **Stockout rate** | <2% of SKUs | % of SKUs unavailable at any time. Every stockout = lost revenue + damaged brand trust. |\n| **Sell-through rate** | >60% at full price | % of inventory sold at full price (not discounted). Intus doesn't discount = this should be 90%+. |\n\n### 5.2 Demand Forecasting (Early-Stage)\n\nWithout historical data, use these signals:\n\n| Signal | What It Tells You | How to Track |\n|--------|-------------------|-------------|\n| **\"Notify me\" signups** | Pre-validated demand for restocks | Shopify \"Back in Stock\" app — track by SKU |\n| **Kit Quiz results** | Which Kit type is most popular | Klaviyo quiz completion data — segment by result |\n| **Social engagement** | Which products generate buzz | Track saves/shares on product posts (higher save rate = higher purchase intent) |\n| **Pre-order conversion** | Demand validation before committing to inventory | Run pre-orders for new colorways/Kits |\n| **Weather data (AU)** | Seasonal demand shifts | Summer = shorts/tanks spike, winter = outerwear + recovery Kit |\n\n### 5.3 Ordering Strategy\n\n| Strategy | When | How |\n|----------|------|-----|\n| **Conservative initial order** | First production run of any new SKU | Order 60% of projected demand. Sell-through validates demand before reorder. |\n| **Pre-order for new drops** | New colorway or Kit launch | \"Coming [date] — Reserve yours\" on PDP. Commit to production only after pre-order volume confirms demand. |\n| **Reorder triggers** | Existing SKUs | Set reorder point at 8 weeks of cover remaining. Lead time from manufacturer = 4-6 weeks typically. |\n| **Safety stock** | Best-selling SKUs only | Keep 2 extra weeks of cover for top 3 SKUs (likely Reformer Kit + Zyra Leggings). |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Packaging & Unboxing Experience\n\n### 6.1 Why Packaging Matters for Intus\n\nUnboxing is a primary TikTok content format in 2025. Camera-ready packaging drives UGC, which drives acquisition (see S03 Channel Benchmarks). For a Magician archetype, the unboxing IS the transformation moment.\n\n### 6.2 Packaging Specification\n\n| Element | Specification | Archetype Alignment |\n|---------|--------------|-------------------|\n| **Outer mailer** | Matte black compostable poly mailer (recycled material) | Magician: dark, mysterious, premium feel. Sustainability: baseline expectation (50%+ consumers value it). |\n| **Inner tissue** | Branded tissue paper with subtle \"Within\" watermark | Sage: attention to detail, intentional presentation |\n| **Insert card** | \"Your Kit. Your Day.\" card with QR code → Care instructions + #MyIntusKit UGC invite | Drives UGC content creation + product care (reduces returns) |\n| **Sticker** | Small branded sticker (laptop/water bottle size) | Community signaling. Low cost, high share rate. |\n| **No plastic** | No poly bags around individual pieces. Roll and tissue-wrap instead. | Sustainability commitment. Gen Z expects this. |\n\n### 6.3 Unboxing UGC Strategy\n\n| Touchpoint | Action |\n|-----------|--------|\n| **Insert card CTA** | \"Share your unboxing → Tag #MyIntusKit → Get featured\" |\n| **Post-purchase SMS** (from S02) | Day 1 after delivery: \"Your Kit has arrived. Show us the moment → #MyIntusKit\" |\n| **Packaging design** | Camera-ready. Black exterior = contrast on camera. Clean interior = satisfying reveal. |\n| **Incentive** | Featured on Intus Instagram/TikTok (social currency, not discount) |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Order Processing SLAs\n\n| Metric | SLA | Rationale |\n|--------|-----|-----------|\n| **Same-day dispatch cutoff** | 2:00 PM AEST (self-fulfil) or per 3PL agreement | Enables 3-5 day domestic delivery. Consumer expectation: ~3.1 days click-to-door. |\n| **Order confirmation email** | Immediate (automated) | Already in Deliverable 12, Flow 4 |\n| **Shipping confirmation + tracking** | Within 2 hours of dispatch | Already in Deliverable 12, Flow 4 |\n| **Delivery confirmation** | Real-time via carrier API | Triggers post-purchase SMS (S02) |\n| **Return processing** | Within 48 hours of receipt | Fast refund = customer goodwill + faster restock |\n| **Customer support response** | <4 hours during business hours, <24 hours after hours | Gorgias or Shopify Inbox. AI-assisted for common queries. |\n\n---\n\n## 8.
