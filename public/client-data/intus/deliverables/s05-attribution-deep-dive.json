  "rawMarkdown": "# Attribution & Analytics Deep Dive — Intus Ecommerce Supplement\n**Supplements:** Deliverable 15 (Measurement Framework & Dashboards)\n**Department:** Market Intelligence & Analytics\n**Intelligence Source:** Ecommerce Analytics Notebook (2025 benchmarks)\n**Date:** February 2026\n\n---\n\n## Why This Supplement Exists\n\nDeliverable 15 built a strong three-phase measurement roadmap (Foundation → Validation → Full Triangulation) with a clear event taxonomy and tiered dashboard. However, it was built before the ecommerce analytics intelligence was available. This supplement adds the specific post-iOS14 attribution realities, Shopify tracking limitations, server-side architecture details, and calibrated benchmarks that Intus needs to make accurate decisions with real data — not platform-inflated numbers.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Attribution Reality in 2025\n\n### 1.1 Platform-Reported Data Is Not Truth\n\nEvery ad platform over-reports conversions because they model data to fill privacy gaps. Here's what Intus needs to know:\n\n| Platform | Attribution Behavior | Impact on Intus |\n|----------|---------------------|----------------|\n| **Meta (IG/FB)** | Over-reports view-through conversions. Claims credit for sales where the ad was viewed but not clicked. Models data to fill iOS ATT gaps. | Meta ROAS will appear higher than reality. Cross-reference every campaign with Shopify actual sales. |\n| **TikTok** | Similar to Meta — heavy reliance on view-through attribution. A user sees a TikTok, searches on Google, buys → TikTok claims the sale. | TikTok will appear to underperform on last-click, but may be driving demand that Google captures. Don't cut TikTok based on GA4 data alone. |\n| **Google** | Under-reports social impact. Favors its own capture channels (Search/Shopping). | Google will look like the hero because it captures demand created by Meta/TikTok. This is not the full picture. |\n| **GA4** | Uses 90-day attribution window. Session-based, not user-based. Breaks cross-device journeys. | GA4 will under-credit channels where users discover on mobile but convert on desktop (common for $100 activewear purchases). |\n\n### 1.2 The Cross-Device Problem\n\nThis is particularly relevant for Intus's audience (18-35, mobile-first):\n\n```\nTypical Intus Customer Journey:\n\nDay 1: Sees TikTok ad on phone → scrolls past\nDay 3: Sees Instagram retargeting ad → clicks, browses Kit PDP → leaves\nDay 5: Googles \"Intus activewear\" on laptop → purchases\n\nWho gets credit?\n- TikTok: \"I showed them the ad!\" (view-through claim)\n- Meta: \"I drove the click!\" (click-through claim)\n- Google: \"I converted them!\" (last-click claim)\n- GA4: Credits Google (last-click default)\n- Shopify: Records the sale, no channel credit\n- Reality: ALL three channels contributed\n```\n\n**Shopify's specific limitation:** Cannot track cross-device journeys. A mobile browse + desktop purchase looks like two different users. This means Shopify's native analytics undercount repeat visitors and over-count new customers.\n\n### 1.3 The \"Never Trust a Single Source\" Rule\n\n| What to Cross-Reference | How |\n|------------------------|-----|\n| Meta-reported conversions | Compare with Shopify orders filtered by UTM source |\n| Platform ROAS | Compare with MER (total revenue / total ad spend) |\n| GA4 channel attribution | Compare with Shopify source data + platform data |\n| Any single metric | Triangulate: Platform says X, Shopify says Y, MER says Z → truth is in the overlap |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Server-Side Tracking Architecture\n\n### 2.1 Why Server-Side Is Non-Negotiable\n\nAfter iOS14/17 and browser tracking prevention, client-side pixels (JavaScript on the page) lose 30-40% of conversion data. Server-side tracking sends data directly from your server to ad platforms, bypassing browser blockers entirely.\n\n### 2.2 Architecture for Intus\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                 CUSTOMER BROWSER                     │\n│  (limited by iOS ATT, ad blockers, cookie expiry)   │\n└─────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────┘\n              │ Client-side pixel (backup only)\n              ▼\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│              SHOPIFY STORE                           │\n│  Orders, customer data, email, phone                │\n└─────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────┘\n              │ Shopify Webhooks (order_created, checkout_completed)\n              ▼\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│     SERVER-SIDE TAG MANAGER / CDP                   │\n│  (Google Tag Manager Server Container               │\n│   OR Triple Whale / Elevar / Littledata)            │\n│                                                     │\n│  Hashes PII (email, phone) → sends to platforms     │\n└──────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬────────────┘\n       │          │          │          │\n       ▼          ▼          ▼          ▼\n   Meta CAPI   TikTok    Google     GA4\n              Events API  Enhanced   Measurement\n                         Conversions Protocol\n```\n\n### 2.3 Implementation Priority & Tools\n\n| Component | Tool | Priority | Setup Time |\n|-----------|------|----------|-----------|\n| **Shopify → GA4** | Littledata or Elevar (Shopify app) | Week 1 | 2-4 hours |\n| **Meta CAPI** | Shopify native integration (Settings → Marketing) | Week 1 | 1-2 hours |\n| **Google Enhanced Conversions** | Shopify → Google Channel app | Week 1 | 1-2 hours |\n| **TikTok Events API** | TikTok for Shopify app | Week 2 | 1-2 hours |\n| **Server GTM container** | Google Tag Manager Server (Cloud Run hosting) | Week 2-3 | 4-8 hours (technical) |\n\n**Match rate targets:**\n- Server-side events should match Shopify order data within 90%+\n- If match rate drops below 85%, audit the integration (missing events, incorrect hashing)\n\n### 2.4 First-Party Data Strategy\n\n92% of brands call first-party data \"essential\" in 2025. For Intus:\n\n| Data Point | Collection Method | Platform Use |\n|-----------|-------------------|-------------|\n| **Email** | Kit Quiz, \"Join the Circle\", checkout | Meta Custom Audiences, Klaviyo, GA4 User-ID |\n| **Phone** | SMS opt-in (S02), checkout | Meta Custom Audiences, SMS platform |\n| **Kit persona** | Quiz result | Segmentation for lookalike audiences |\n| **Purchase history** | Shopify | LTV-based audience building for Meta value-based bidding |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Metric Hierarchy: MER vs. ROAS vs. nROAS\n\n### 3.1 When to Use Each\n\n| Metric | Formula | Use Case | Frequency |\n|--------|---------|----------|-----------|\n| **MER** | Total Revenue / Total Ad Spend | North Star for overall business health. \"Is our marketing profitable?\" | Daily (pacing), Weekly (trend) |\n| **ROAS** | Channel Revenue / Channel Ad Spend | Tactical campaign optimization. \"Is this specific campaign efficient?\" | Daily |\n| **nROAS** | New Customer Revenue / Ad Spend | Scaling decisions. \"Are we acquiring genuinely new customers?\" | Weekly |\n| **Contribution Margin** | Revenue - COGS - Shipping - Returns - Ad Spend | True profitability. \"Are we actually making money after all costs?\" | Monthly |\n\n### 3.2 Benchmarks for Intus\n\n| Metric | Launch (Month 1-3) | Growth (Month 4-6) | Scale (Month 7+) |\n|--------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|\n| **MER** | >2.5x | >3.0x | >3.5x |\n| **Blended ROAS** | >2.0x | >2.5x | >3.0x |\n| **nROAS** | >3.0x | >3.5x | >4.0x |\n| **Meta ROAS** | >2.5x (remember: over-reported) | >3.0x | >3.5x |\n| **Google ROAS** | >4.0x (high-intent capture) | >5.0x | >6.0x |\n| **TikTok ROAS** | >1.5x (awareness + halo) | >2.0x | >2.5x |\n\n### 3.3 The \"Halo Effect\" Test\n\nDon't cut TikTok spend based on last-click ROAS alone. Instead:\n\n1. Run TikTok at current budget for 2 weeks. Track branded search volume.\n2. Pause TikTok for 2 weeks. Track branded search volume.\n3. If branded search drops when TikTok pauses → TikTok is creating demand that Google captures.\n4. This is the \"halo effect\" — TikTok's real value is higher than its reported ROAS.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Attribution Model Recommendations (Revised)\n\n### 4.1 Updated from Deliverable 15\n\nDeliverable 15 recommended Time Decay (7-day lookback) as the Phase A model. With 2025 ecommerce analytics intelligence, here's the updated recommendation:\n\n| Phase | Primary Model | Rationale |\n|-------|--------------|-----------|\n| **Phase A (Month 1-3)** | **Data-Driven Attribution (DDA)** in GA4 | AI-driven, assigns fractional credit based on actual contribution. Superior to static rule-based models like Time Decay. GA4 now supports DDA as default for all properties. |\n| **Phase B (Month 4-6)** | DDA + Incrementality tests | DDA for daily decisions. Geo-lift tests to validate whether channels are truly incremental. |\n| **Phase C (Month 7+)** | DDA + MMM + Incrementality | Full triangulation. DDA for campaign-level, MMM for budget allocation, incrementality for truth-checking. |\n\n### 4.2 Why Data-Driven Over Time Decay\n\n| Factor | Time Decay (Deliverable 15) | Data-Driven (Revised) |\n|--------|---------------------------|----------------------|\n| **How it works** | Fixed rule: more credit to recent touchpoints | ML model: learns from your actual data which touchpoints matter |\n| **Adapts to your business** | No — same formula for every brand | Yes — learns Intus-specific patterns |\n| **Handles video discovery** | Poorly — under-credits TikTok/Reels discovery | Better — can learn that video views correlate with later purchases |\n| **GA4 support** | Available but legacy | Default in GA4 2025 |\n\n### 4.3 Last-Click Still Has a Role\n\nUse last-click as a **cash-flow check** — \"which channel is directly closing sales right now?\" — but never as the sole decision-making model. It systematically under-credits:\n- Brand awareness (TikTok, YouTube)\n- Email nurture (welcome sequences)\n- Social proof (UGC exposure)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Incrementality Testing (Enhanced from Deliverable 15)\n\n### 5.1 Budget Requirements\n\n| Test Type | Minimum Budget | Minimum Duration | When to Run |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| **Geo-Lift (Meta)** | $3,000-5,000 AUD ad spend during test period | 4 weeks | Month 4+ (need baseline data first) |\n| **Email Holdout** | No ad budget needed (email is owned) | 4 weeks | Month 3+ |\n| **TikTok Halo Test** | Current TikTok budget (just pause/resume) | 4 weeks (2 on, 2 off) | Month 4+ |\n| **Studio Channel Validation** | No ad budget (operational cost only) | 4 weeks | Month 4+ |\n\n### 5.2 Geo-Lift Test Protocol (Meta)\n\n**Enhanced from Deliverable 15, Test 1:**\n\n| Parameter | Setting | Note |\n|-----------|---------|------|\n| **Test market** | Melbourne | Intus home market, highest organic awareness |\n| **Control market** | Sydney | Similar demographics, suppress all Meta ads |\n| **Budget** | Maintain current Meta spend in Melbourne, $0 in Sydney | Sydney still gets organic + email + TikTok |\n| **Measurement** | Compare Shopify sales lift: Melbourne vs. Sydney | Use Shopify shipping address to segment |\n| **Success criteria** | Melbourne shows >20% higher sales per capita | Statistically significant lift = Meta is incremental |\n| **If no lift** | Meta may be claiming credit for organic demand. Reduce Meta budget, reallocate to TikTok/Google. | This is the value of testing — knowing where NOT to spend |\n\n### 5.3 Real-World Validation\n\nCase study: Honasa (The Derma Co) ran a conversion lift test on Performance Max and found it drove a 37% incremental revenue lift with an incremental ROAS (iROAS) of 0.94 — far higher than their estimated 0.4. Without incrementality testing, they would have under-invested in a profitable channel.\n\n---\n\n## 6. GA4 Custom Event Taxonomy (Enhanced)\n\n### 6.1 Beyond Deliverable 15's Taxonomy\n\nDeliverable 15 defined core events (page_view, view_item, quiz_start, etc.). These additions capture the micro-behaviors that drive optimization:\n\n| Event | Trigger | Parameters | Why Track |\n|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| `size_guide_view` | Click on size guide/fit tool | item_id, source_page | Fit is #1 friction point in activewear. High usage + low conversion = size guide needs improvement. |\n| `variant_select` | Click on color/size swatch | item_id, variant (color/size) | Detect demand for out-of-stock variants. Feed into inventory planning. |\n| `video_start` | On-site product video begins | item_id, video_type (lifestyle/product) | Measure video engagement on PDP. |\n| `video_complete` | Video watched to end | item_id, video_type, duration | Viewers who complete video convert at higher rates — validate this for Intus. |\n| `stock_status_view` | Product viewed when out-of-stock | item_id, variant | Track lost revenue from stockouts. Feed \"Notify me\" signup rate. |\n| `notify_signup` | \"Notify me when back\" submission | item_id, variant, email | Pre-validated demand signal for inventory decisions. |\n| `guarantee_view` | Click on 60-day guarantee details | source_page | Measure how many people need guarantee reassurance before purchasing. |\n| `kit_compare` | User views 2+ Kit pages in same session | kit_types_viewed | Understand Kit decision process. If high compare + low purchase = confusion. |\n| `chat_initiated` | AI shopping assistant opened | source_page, trigger_type | Measure chat impact on conversion (see S01). |\n| `upsell_click` | Click on \"Complete Your Kit\" suggestion | source_item, suggested_item | Track cross-sell effectiveness. |\n\n### 6.2 Event Implementation Priority\n\n| Priority | Events | Why First |\n|----------|--------|-----------|\n| **Week 1** | size_guide_view, variant_select, stock_status_view | Direct revenue impact — identify friction + lost demand |\n| **Week 2** | video_start, video_complete, guarantee_view | Content optimization — understand what content drives conversion |\n| **Week 3** | notify_signup, kit_compare, chat_initiated, upsell_click | Feature optimization — measure new features from supplements |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Dashboard Enhancements (Revised Tiers)\n\n### 7.1 Daily Dashboard (Health Check)\n\n| KPI | Target | Source | Alert Threshold |\n|-----|--------|--------|----------------|\n| **MER** | >2.5x (launch), >3.0x (growth) | Shopify Revenue / Total Ad Spend | <2.0x for 3+ days |\n| **Blended ROAS** | >2.0x | Platform data (directional only) | <1.5x for 3+ days |\n| **Daily CAC** | <$30 AUD prospecting | Platform + Shopify cross-ref | >$45 for 3+ days |\n| **Daily revenue** | Pacing to monthly target | Shopify | <70% of daily target |\n| **Site sessions** | Growing or stable | GA4 | >20% decline day-over-day |\n\n### 7.2 Weekly Dashboard (Optimization)\n\n| KPI | Target | Benchmark Source | Action if Below |\n|-----|--------|-----------------|----------------|\n| **Conversion rate** | >3.0% | Fashion/apparel benchmark: 3.01% | Audit PDP, checkout, mobile experience |\n| **Add-to-cart rate** | >6.5% | Apparel benchmark: 6.3-7.1% | PDP optimization (see S01) |\n| **Cart abandonment** | <70% | Industry: 70-75%. >80% = emergency | Audit checkout (see S01 Section 3) |\n| **Mobile conversion** | >2.0% | Mobile avg: 1.8%, desktop: 3.9% | Mobile CRO priority (see S01 Section 4) |\n| **nROAS** | >3.0x | Calculated (new customer rev / ad spend) | Channel reallocation |\n| **Email RPR** | >$0.11 | Campaign email benchmark | Content/segmentation test |\n| **SMS RPR** | >$0.80 | Top 10% apparel benchmark (see S02) | Frequency/content test |\n\n### 7.3 Monthly Dashboard (Strategy)\n\n| KPI | Target | Source | Action if Below |\n|-----|--------|--------|----------------|\n| **Contribution margin** | Positive and growing | Revenue - COGS - Shipping - Returns - Ads | Cost audit (see S04 for operations costs) |\n| **New vs. returning customer mix** | 60-70% new (launch phase) → 50/50 (growth) | Shopify | If >80% new: retention problem. If <40% new: acquisition problem. |\n| **LTV (60-day)** | >$130 (1.3x first purchase) | Shopify cohort analysis | VIP program not working (see S02 Section 3) |\n| **LTV (90-day)** | >$150 | Shopify cohort analysis | Repeat purchase flows need optimization |\n| **Return rate** | <18% | Shopify returns data | Fit tools, size guide (see S01 Section 2.2) |\n| **List growth (email)** | 3-5% monthly | Klaviyo | Popup optimization (see S02 Section 4) |\n| **List growth (SMS)** | 2-3% monthly | Klaviyo | SMS opt-in rate below 15% at checkout |\n\n---\n\n## 8. Platform Discrepancy Handling Protocol\n\nWhen platform data conflicts with Shopify (which it will), use this decision framework:\n\n| Scenario | What's Happening | What to Do |\n|----------|-----------------|-----------|\n| **Meta reports 50 conversions, Shopify shows 35** | Meta is over-counting view-throughs | Use Shopify as truth for revenue. Use Meta data for creative optimization (relative performance between ads). |\n| **Google reports high ROAS, TikTok reports low** | Google is capturing demand TikTok created | Run the halo test (Section 3.3). Don't cut TikTok based on last-click. |\n| **GA4 shows different numbers than Shopify** | Cross-device breaks, consent mode gaps, session vs. transaction mismatch | GA4 for journey analysis, Shopify for revenue truth. |\n| **MER looks good but nROAS is low** | You're retargeting existing customers, not acquiring new ones | Separate new vs. returning in all platform campaigns. Increase prospecting budget. |\n| **All platforms claim credit for the same sale** | Attribution overlap (normal) | This is why triangulation exists. Total attributed conversions will always exceed actual conversions. Use MER as the reality check. |\n\n---\n\n## 9.
